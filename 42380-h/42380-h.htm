<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Editor of the English translation of 'L'Homme Primitif,' has
not deemed it necessary to reproduce the original Preface, in which
M. Figuier states his purpose in offering a new work on pre-historic
archæology to the French public, already acquainted in translation
with the works on the subject by Sir Charles Lyell and Sir John
Lubbock. Now that the book has taken its position in France, it
is only needful to point out its claims to the attention of English
readers.</p>

<p>The important art of placing scientific knowledge, and especially
new discoveries and topics of present controversy, within easy reach
of educated readers not versed in their strictly technical details, is
one which has for years been carried to remarkable perfection in
France, in no small measure through the labours and example of
M. Figuier himself. The present volume, one of his series, takes up
the subject of Pre-historic Man, beginning with the remotely ancient
stages of human life belonging to the Drift-Beds, Bone-Caves, and
Shell-Heaps, passing on through the higher levels of the Stone Age,
through the succeeding Bronze Age, and into those lower ranges of
the Iron Age in which civilisation, raised to a comparatively high
development, passes from the hands of the antiquary into those of the
historian. The Author's object has been to give within the limits of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">
[Pg vi]</a></span>a volume, and dispensing with the fatiguing enumeration of details
required in special memoirs, an outline sufficient to afford a reasonable
working acquaintance with the facts and arguments of the science to
such as cannot pursue it further, and to serve as a starting-ground for
those who will follow it up in the more minute researches of Nilsson,
Keller, Lartet, Christy, Lubbock, Mortillet, Desor, Troyon, Gastaldi,
and others.</p>

<p>The value of the work to English archæologists, however, is not
merely that of a clear popular manual; pre-historic archæology, worked
as it has been in several countries, takes in each its proper local colour,
and brings forward its proper local evidence. It is true that much of
its material is used as common property by scientific men at large.
But, for instance, where an English writer in describing the ancient
cave-men would dwell especially on the relics from the caves of
Devon and Somerset as worked by Falconer and Pengelly, a French
writer would take his data more amply from the explorations of caves
of the south of France by De Vibraye, Garrigou, and Filhol&mdash;where
the English teacher would select his specimens from the Christy or the
Blackmore Museum, the French teacher would have recourse to the
Musée de Saint-Germain. Thus far, the English student has in
Figuier's 'Primitive Man' not a work simply incorporated from
familiar materials, but to a great extent bringing forward evidence
not readily accessible, or quite new to him.</p>

<p>Some corrections and alterations have been made in the English
edition. The illustrations are those of the original work; the facsimiles
of pre-historic objects have been in great part drawn expressly
for it, and contribute to its strictly scientific value; the page illustrations
representing scenes of primitive life, which are by another
hand, may seem somewhat fanciful, yet, setting aside the Raffaelesque
idealism of their style, it will be found on examination that they are
in the main justified by that soundest evidence, the actual discovery
of the objects of which they represent the use.</p>

<p>The solid distinctness of this evidence from actual relics of pre-historic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">
[Pg vii]</a></span>life is one of the reasons which have contributed to the
extraordinary interest which pre-historic archæology has excited in
an age averse to vague speculation, but singularly appreciative of
arguments conducted by strict reasoning on facts. The study of this
modern science has supplied a fundamental element to the general
theory of civilisation, while, as has been the case with geology, its
bearing on various points of theological criticism has at once conduced
to its active investigation, and drawn to it the most eager popular
attention. Thus, in bringing forward a new work on 'Primitive
Man,' there is happily no need of insisting on the importance of its
subject-matter, or of attempting to force unappreciated knowledge on
an unwilling public. It is only necessary to attest its filling an open
place in the literature of pre-historic archæology.</p>

<p class="c"><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Forty</span> years have scarcely elapsed since scientific men first began to
attribute to the human race an antiquity more remote than that which
is assigned to them by history and tradition. Down to a comparatively
recent time, the appearance of primitive man was not
dated back beyond a period of 6000 to 7000 years. This historical
chronology was a little unsettled by the researches made among
various eastern nations&mdash;the Chinese, the Egyptians, and the Indians.
The <i>savants</i> who studied these ancient systems of civilisation found
themselves unable to limit them to the 6000 years of the standard
chronology, and extended back for some thousands of years the antiquity
of the eastern races.</p>

<p>This idea, however, never made its way beyond the narrow circle
of oriental scholars, and did nothing towards any alteration in the
general opinion, which allowed only 6000 years since the creation
of the human species.</p>

<p>This opinion was confirmed, and, to some extent, rendered sacred
by an erroneous interpretation of Holy Writ. It was thought that
the Old Testament stated that man was created 6000 years ago.
Now, the fact is, nothing of the kind can be found in the Book of
Genesis. It is only the commentators and the compilers of chronological
systems who have put forward this date as that of the first
appearance of the human race. M. Édouard Lartet, who was called,
in 1869, to the chair of palæontology in the Museum of Natural
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"> [Pg 2]</a></span>
History of Paris, reminds us, in the following passage taken from one
of his elegant dissertations, that it is the chronologists alone who
have propounded this idea, and that they have, in this respect, very
wrongly interpreted the statements of the Bible:</p>

<p>"In <i>Genesis</i>," says M. Lartet, "no date can be found which sets a
limit to the time at which primitive mankind may have made its first
appearance. Chronologists, however, for fifteen centuries have been
endeavouring to make Biblical facts fall in with the preconcerted
arrangements of their systems. Thus, we find that more than 140
opinions have been brought forward as to the date of the creation
alone, and that, between the varying extremes, there is a difference
of 3194 years&mdash;a difference which only applies to the period between
the commencement of the world and the birth of Jesus Christ. This
disagreement turns chiefly on those portions of the interval which
are in closest proximity to the creation.</p>

<p>"From the moment when it becomes a recognised fact that the
origin of mankind is a question independent of all subordination to
dogma, this question will assume its proper position as a scientific
thesis, and will be accessible to any kind of discussion, and capable, in
every point of view, of receiving the solution which best harmonises
with the known facts and experimental demonstrations."
<a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Thus, we must not assume that the authority of Holy Writ is in
any way questioned by those labours which aim at seeking the real
epoch of man's first appearance on the earth.</p>

<p>In corroboration of M. Lartet's statement, we must call to mind
that the Catholic church, which has raised to the rank of dogma so
many unimportant facts, has never desired to treat in this way the
idea that man was created only 6000 years ago.</p>

<p>There is, therefore, no need for surprise when we learn that certain
members of the Catholic clergy have devoted themselves with
energy to the study of pre-historic man. Mgr. Meignan, Bishop of
Châlons-sur-Marne, is one of the best-informed men in France as
respects this new science; he cultivates it with the utmost zeal, and
his personal researches have added much to the sum of our knowledge of
this question. Under the title of 'Le Monde et l'Homme Primitif
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"> [Pg 3]</a></span>
selon la Bible,'<a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the learned Bishop of Châlons-sur-Marne published,
in 1869, a voluminous work, in which, taking up the subjects discussed
by Marcel de Serres in his "Cosmogonie de Moïse, comparée aux Faits
Géologiques,"<a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and enlarging upon the facts which science has recently
acquired as to the subject of primitive man, he seeks to establish the
coincidence of all these data with the records of Revelation.</p>

<p>M. l'Abbé Lambert has recently published a work on 'L'Homme
Primitif et la Bible,'<a name="fnanchor_4" id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a> in which he proves that the discoveries of
modern science concerning the antiquity of man are in no way
opposed to the records of Revelation in the Book of Moses.</p>

<p>Lastly, it is a member of the clerical body, M. l'Abbé Bourgeois,
who, more a royalist than the king&mdash;that is, more advanced in his
views than most contemporary geologists&mdash;is in favour of tracing
back to the tertiary epoch the earliest date of the existence of man.
We shall have to impugn this somewhat exaggerated opinion, which,
indeed, we only quote here for the sake of proving that the theological
scruples which so long arrested the progress of inquiry with regard to
primitive man, have now disappeared, in consequence of the perfect
independence of this question in relation to catholic dogma being
evidently shown.</p>

<p>Thanks to the mutual support which has been afforded by the three
sister-sciences&mdash;geology, palæontology, and archæology,&mdash;thanks to
the happy combinations which these sciences have presented to the
efforts of men animated with an ardent zeal for the investigation of
the truth;&mdash;and thanks, lastly, to the unbounded interest which
attaches to this subject, the result has been that the limits which had
been so long attributed to the existence of the human species have
been extraordinarily extended, and the date of the first appearance of
man has been carried back to the night of the darkest ages. The
mind, it may well be said, recoils dismayed when it undertakes the
computation of the thousands of years which have elapsed since the
creation of man.</p>

<p>But, it will naturally be asked, on what grounds do you base this
assertion? What evidence do you bring forward, and what are the
elements of your proof?</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"> [Pg 4]</a></span></p>
<p>In the following paragraphs we give some of the principal means
of examination and study which have directed the efforts of <i>savants</i>
in this class of investigation, and have enabled them to create a
science of the antiquity of the human species.</p>

<p>If man existed at any very remote epoch, he must have left traces
of his presence in the spots which he inhabited and on the soil which
he trod under his feet. However savage his state may be assumed
to have been, primitive man must have possessed some implements of
fishing and hunting&mdash;some weapons wherewith to strike down any
prey which was stronger or more agile than himself. All human
beings have been in possession of some scrap of clothing; and they
have had at their command certain implements more or less rough in
their character, be they only a shell in which to draw water or a tool
for cleaving wood and constructing some place of shelter, a knife
to cut their food, and a lump of stone to break the bones of the
animals which served for their nutriment. Never has man existed
who was not in possession of some kind of defensive weapon. These
implements and these weapons have been patiently sought for, and
they have also been found. They have been found in certain strata
of the earth, the age of which is known by geologists; some of these
strata precede and others are subsequent to the cataclysm of the
European deluge of the quaternary epoch.</p>

<p>The fact has thus been proved that a race of men lived upon the
earth at the epoch settled by the geological age of these strata&mdash;that
is, during the quaternary epoch.</p>

<p>When this class of evidence of man's presence&mdash;that is, the vestiges
of his primitive industry&mdash;fails us, a state of things, however, which
comparatively seldom occurs, his existence is sometimes revealed by
the presence of human bones buried in the earth and preserved
through long ages by means of the deposits of calcareous salts which
have petrified or rather <i>fossilised</i> them. Sometimes, in fact, the
remains of human bones have been found in quaternary rocks, which
are, consequently, considerably anterior to those of the present geological
epoch.</p>

<p>This means of proof is, however, more difficult to bring forward
than the preceding class of evidence; because human bones are very
liable to decay when they are buried at shallow depths, and require
for any length of preservation a concurrence of circumstances which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"> [Pg 5]</a></span>
is but rarely met with; because also the tribes of primitive man often
burnt their dead bodies; and, lastly, because the human race then
formed but a very scanty population.</p>

<p>Another excellent proof, which demonstrates the existence of man
at a geological epoch anterior to the present era, is to be deduced
from the intermixture of human bones with those of antediluvian
animals. It is evident that if we meet with the bones of the
mammoth, the cave-bear, the cave-tiger, &amp;c.,&mdash;animals which lived
only in the quaternary epoch and are now extinct&mdash;in conjunction
with the bones of man or the relics of his industry, such as weapons,
implements, utensils, &amp;c., we can assert with some degree of certainty
that our species was contemporaneous with the above-named animals.
Now this intermixture has often been met with under the ground in
caves, or deeply buried in the earth.</p>

<p>These form the various kinds of proof which have been made use
of to establish the fact of man's presence upon the earth during the
quaternary epoch. We will now give a brief recital of the principal
investigations which have contributed to the knowledge on which is
based the newly-formed science which treats of the practical starting-point
of mankind.</p>

<p>Palæontology, as a science, does not count more than half a century
of existence. We scarcely seem, indeed, to have raised more than one
corner of the veil which covers the relics of an extinct world; as yet,
for instance, we know absolutely nothing of all that sleeps buried in
the depths of the earth lying under the basin of the sea. It need
not, therefore, afford any great ground for surprise that so long a
time elapsed before human bones or the vestiges of the primitive
industry of man were discovered in the quaternary rocks. This
negative result, however, always constituted the chief objection against
the very early origin of our species.</p>

<p>The errors and deceptions which were at first encountered tended
perhaps to cool down the zeal of the earlier naturalists, and thus
retarded the solution of the problem. It is a well-known story about
the fossil salamander of the &OElig;ningen quarries, which, on the testimony
of Scheuchzer, was styled in 1726, the "human witness of the
deluge" (<i>homo diluvii testis</i>). In 1787, Peter Camper recognised
the fact that this pretended <i>pre-Adamite</i> was nothing but a reptile;
this discomfiture, which was a source of amusement to the whole of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"> [Pg 6]</a></span>
scientific Europe, was a real injury to the cause of antediluvian man.
By the sovereign ascendancy of ridicule, his existence was henceforth
relegated to the domain of fable.</p>

<p>The first step in advance was, however, taken in 1774. Some
human bones, mingled with remains of the great bear and other
species then unknown, were discovered by J. F. Esper, in the celebrated
cavern of Gailenreuth, in Bavaria.</p>

<p>Even before this date, in the early part of the eighteenth century,
Kemp, an Englishman, had found in London, by the side of elephants'
teeth, a stone hatchet, similar to those which have been subsequently
found in great numbers in various parts of the world. This hatchet
was roughly sketched, and the design published in 1715. The original
still exists in the collection at the British Museum.</p>

<p>In 1797, John Frere, an English archæologist, discovered at Hoxne,
in Suffolk, under strata of quaternary rocks, some flint weapons, intermingled
with bones of animals belonging to extinct species. Esper
concluded that these weapons and the men who made them were
anterior to the formation of the beds in which they were found.</p>

<p>According to M. Lartet, the honour of having been the first to
proclaim the high antiquity of the human species must be attributed
to Aimé Boué, a French geologist residing in Germany. In 1823,
he found in the quaternary loam (loess) of the Valley of the Rhine
some human bones which he presented to Cuvier and Brongniart
as those of men who lived in the quaternary epoch.</p>

<p>In 1823, Dr. Buckland, the English geologist, published his
'Reliquiæ Diluvianæ,' a work which was principally devoted to a
description of the Kirkdale Cave, in which the author combined all
the facts then known which tended in favour of the co-existence of
man and the antediluvian animals.</p>

<p>Cuvier, too, was not so indisposed as he is generally said to have
been, to admit the existence of man in the quaternary epoch. In his
work on 'Ossements Fossiles,' and his 'Discours sur les Révolutions
du Globe,' the immortal naturalist discusses the pros and cons with
regard to this question, and, notwithstanding the insufficiency of the
data which were then forthcoming, he felt warranted in saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am not inclined to conclude that man had no existence at all
before the epoch of the great revolutions of the earth.... He
might have inhabited certain districts of no great extent, whence,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"> [Pg 7]</a></span>
after these terrible events, he repeopled the world; perhaps, also, the
spots where he abode were swallowed up, and his bones lie buried
under the beds of the present seas."</p>

<p>The confident appeals which have been made to Cuvier's authority
against the high antiquity of man are, therefore, not justified by the
facts.</p>

<p>A second and more decisive step in advance was taken by the discovery
of shaped flints and other implements belonging to primitive
man, existing in diluvial beds.</p>

<p>In 1826, M. Tournal, of Narbonne, a French archæologist and
geologist, published an account of the discoveries which he had made
in a cave in the department of Aude, in which he found bones of the
bison and reindeer fashioned by the hand of man, accompanied by the
remains of edible shell-fish, which must have been brought there by
men who had made their residence in this cave.</p>

<p>Three years afterwards, M. de Christol, of Montpellier, subsequently
Professor in the University of Science of Grenoble, found human
bones intimately mixed up with remains of the great bear, hyæna,
rhinoceros, &amp;c., in the caverns of Pondres and Souvignargues
(Hérault). In the last of these caverns fragments of pottery formed
a part of the relics.</p>

<p>All these striking facts were put together and discussed by Marcel
de Serres, Professor in the University of Science at Montpellier, in his
'Essai sur les Cavernes.'</p>

<p>The two bone-caverns of Engis and Enghihoul (Belgium) have
furnished proofs of the same kind. In 1833, Schmerling, a learned
Belgian geologist, discovered in these caverns two human skulls,
mixed with the teeth of the rhinoceros, elephant, bear, hyæna, &amp;c.
The human bones were rubbed and worn away like those of the
animals. The bones of the latter presented, besides, traces of human
workmanship. Lastly, as if no evidence should be wanting, flints
chipped to form knives and arrow-heads were found in the same
spot.</p>

<p>In connection with his laborious investigations, Schmerling published
a work which is now much esteemed, and proves that the
Belgian geologist well merited the title of being the founder of the
science of the antiquity of man. In this work Schmerling describes
and represents a vast quantity of objects which had been discovered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"> [Pg 8]</a></span>
in the caverns of Belgium, and introduced to notice the human skull
which has since become so famous under the name of the <i>Engis skull</i>.
But at that time scientific men of all countries were opposed to this
class of ideas, and thus the discoveries of the Belgian geologist attracted
no more attention than those of his French brethren who had
brought forward facts of a similar nature.</p>

<p>In 1835, M. Joly, at that time Professor at the Lyceum of Montpellier&mdash;where
I (the author) attended on his course of Natural
History&mdash;now Professor in the Faculty of Sciences at Toulouse,
found in the cave of Nabrigas (Lozère) the skull of a cave-bear, on
which an arrow had left its evident traces. Close by was a fragment
of pottery bearing the imprints of the fingers of the man who
moulded it.</p>

<p>We may well be surprised that, in the face of all these previous
discoveries, Boucher de Perthes, the ardent apostle in proclaiming the
high antiquity of our species, should have met with so much opposition
and incredulity; or that he should have had to strive against so
much indifference, when, beginning with the year 1836, he began to
maintain this idea in a series of communications addressed to the
Société d'Emulation of Abbeville.</p>

<p>The horizontal strata of the quarternary beds, known under the
name of <i>diluvial</i>, form banks of different shades and material, which
place before our eyes in indelible characters the ancient history of our
globe. The organic remains which are found in them are those of
beings who were witnesses to the diluvial cataclysm, and perhaps preceded
it by many ages.</p>

<p>"Therefore," says the prophet of Abbeville, "it is in these ruins of
the old world, and in the deposits which have become his sole archives,
that we must seek out the traditions of primitive man; and in default
of coins and inscriptions we must rely on the rough stones which,
in all their imperfection, prove the existence of man no less surely
than all the glory of a Louvre."</p>

<p>Strong in this conviction, M. Boucher de Perthes devoted himself
ardently to the search in the diluvial beds, either for the bony relics
of man, or, at all events, for the material indications of his primitive
industry. In the year 1838 he had the honour of submitting to the
Société d'Emulation, at Abbeville, his first specimens of the antediluvian
hatchet.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"> [Pg 9]</a></span></p>
<p>In the course of the year 1839, Boucher de Perthes took these
hatchets to Paris and showed them to several members of the Institute.
MM. Alexandre Brongniart, Flourens, Elie de Beaumont, Cordier,
and Jomard, gave at first some encouragement to researches which
promised to be so fruitful in results; but this favourable feeling was
not destined to last long.</p>

<p>These rough specimens of wrought flint, in which Boucher de
Perthes already recognised a kind of hatchet, presented very indistinct
traces of chipping, and the angles were blunted; their flattened shape,
too, differed from that of the polished hatchets, the only kind that
were then known. It was certainly necessary to see with the eyes
of faith in order to discern the traces of man's work. "I," says the
Abbeville archæologist, "had these 'eyes of faith,' but no one shared
them with me." He then made up his mind to seek for help
in his labour, and trained workmen to dig in the diluvial beds.
Before long he was able to collect, in the quarternary beds at
Abbeville, twenty specimens of flint evidently wrought by the hand of
man.</p>

<p>In 1842, the Geological Society of London received a communication
from Mr. Godwin Austen, who had found in Kent's Hole various
wrought objects, accompanied by animal remains, which must have
remained there since the deluge.</p>

<p>In 1844, appeared Lund's observations on the caverns of Brazil.</p>

<p>Lund explored as many as 800 caves. In one of them,
situated not far from the lake of Semidouro, he found the bones of
no less than thirty individuals of the human species, showing a
similar state of decomposition to that of the bones of animals which
were along with them. Among these animals were an ape, various
carnivora, rodents, pachyderms, sloths, &amp;c. From these facts,
Lund inferred that man must have been contemporaneous with
the megatherium, the mylodon, &amp;c., animals which characterised the
quarternary epoch.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, M. Desnoyers, librarian of the Museum of Natural
History at Paris, in a very learned article on 'Grottos and Caverns,'
published in 1845 in the 'Dictionnaire Universel d'Histoire Naturelle,'
still energetically expressed himself in opposition to the hypothesis
of the high antiquity of man. But the discoveries continued
to go on; and, at the present time, M. Desnoyers himself figures
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"> [Pg 10]</a></span>
among the partisans of the antediluvian man. He has even gone
beyond their opinions, as he forms one among those who would carry
back to the tertiary epoch the earliest date of the appearance of our
species.</p>

<p>In 1847, M'Enery found in Kent's Hole, a cavern in England,
under a layer of stalagmite, the remains of men and antediluvian
animals mingled together.</p>

<p>The year 1847 was also marked by the appearance of the first
volume of the 'Antiquités Celtiques et Antédiluviennes,' by Boucher
de Perthes; this contained about 1600 plates of the objects which had
been discovered in the excavations which the author had caused to
be made since the year 1836.</p>

<p>The strata at Abbeville, where Boucher de Perthes carried out his
researches, belong to the quaternary epoch.</p>

<p>Dr. Rigollot, who had been for ten years one of the most decided
opponents of the opinions of Boucher de Perthes, actually himself
discovered in 1854 some wrought flints in the quaternary deposits at
Saint Acheul, near Amiens, and it was not long before he took his
stand under the banner of the Abbeville archæologist.</p>

<p>The <i>fauna</i> of the Amiens deposits is similar to that of the Abbeville
beds. The lower deposits of gravel, in which the wrought flints
are met with, have been formed by fresh water, and have not undergone
either alteration or disturbance. The flints wrought by the
hand of man which have been found in them, have in all probability
lain there since the epoch of the formation of these deposits&mdash;an epoch
a little later than the diluvial period. The number of wrought flints
which have been taken out of the Abbeville beds is really immense. At
Menchecourt, in twenty years, about 100 well-characterised hatchets
have been collected; at Saint Gilles twenty very rough, and as many
well-made ones; at Moulin-Quignon 150 to 200 well-formed
hatchets.</p>

<p>Similar relics of primitive industry have been found also in other
localities. In 1853, M. Noulet discovered some in the Infernat
Valley (Haute-Garonne); in 1858, the English geologists, Messrs.
Prestwich, Falconer, Pengelly, &amp;c., also found some in the lower
strata of the Baumann cavern in the Hartz.</p>

<p>To the English geologists whose names we have just mentioned
must be attributed the merit of having been the first to bring before
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"> [Pg 11]</a></span>
the scientific world the due value of the labours of Boucher de Perthes,
who had as yet been unsuccessful in obtaining any acceptation of his
ideas in France. Dr. Falconer, Vice-president of the Geological
Society in London, visited the department of the Somme, in order to
study the beds and the objects found in them. After him, Messrs.
Prestwich and Evans came three times to Abbeville in the year 1859.
They all brought back to England a full conviction of the antiquity
and intact state of the beds explored, and also of the existence of man
before the deluge of the quaternary epoch.</p>

<p>In another journey, made in company with Messrs. Flower, Mylne,
and Godwin Austen, Messrs. Prestwich, Falconer, and Evans were
present at the digging out of human bones and flint hatchets from the
quarries of St. Acheul. Lastly, Sir C. Lyell visited the spot, and the
English geologist, who, up to that time, had opposed the idea of the
existence of antediluvian man, was able to say, <i>Veni, vidi, victus fui!</i>
At the meeting of the British Association, at Aberdeen, September
the 15th, 1855, Sir C. Lyell declared himself to be in favour of the
existence of quaternary man; and this declaration, made by the
President of the Geological Society of London, added considerable
weight to the new ideas.</p>

<p>M. Hébert, Professor of Geology at the Sorbonne, next took his
stand under the same banner.</p>

<p>M. Albert Gaudry, another French geologist, made a statement to
the Academy of Sciences, that he, too, had found flint hatchets,
together with the teeth of horses and fossil oxen, in the beds of the
Parisian <i>diluvium</i>.</p>

<p>During the same year, M. Gosse, the younger, explored the sand-pits
of Grenelle and the avenue of La Mothe-Piquet in Paris, and
obtained from them various flint implements, mingled with the bones
of the mammoth, fossil ox, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Facts of a similar character were established at Précy-sur-Oise, and
in the diluvial deposits at Givry.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Vibraye, also, found in the cave of Arcy, various
human bones, especially a piece of a jaw-bone, mixed with the bones
of animals of extinct species.</p>

<p>In 1859, M. A. Fontan found in the cave of Massat (department
of Ariége), not only utensils testifying to the former presence of man,
but also human teeth mixed up with the remains of the great bear
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"> [Pg 12]</a></span>
(<i>Ursus spelæus</i>), the fossil hyæna (<i>Hyæna spelæa</i>), and the cave-lion
(<i>Felis spelæa</i>).</p>

<p>In 1861, M. A. Milne Edwards found in the cave of Lourdes
(Tarn), certain relics of human industry by the side of the bones of
fossil animals.</p>

<p>The valleys of the Oise and the Seine have also added their contingent
to the supply of antediluvian remains. In the sand-pits in
the environs of Paris, at Grenelle, Levallois-Perret, and Neuilly,
several naturalists, including MM. Gosse, Martin, and Reboux, found
numerous flint implements, associated, in certain cases, with the bones
of the elephant and hippopotamus. In the valley of the Oise, at
Précy, near Creil, MM. Peigné Delacour and Robert likewise collected
a few hatchets.</p>

<p>Lastly, a considerable number of French departments, especially
those of the north and centre, have been successfully explored. We
may mention the departments of Pas-de-Calais, Aisne, Loire-et-Cher,
Indre-et-Loire, Vienne, Allier, Yonne, Saône-et-Loire, Hérault, Tarn-et-Garonne,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>In England, too, discoveries were made of an equally valuable
character. The movement which was commenced in France by
Boucher de Perthes, spread in England with remarkable rapidity.
In many directions excavations were made which produced excellent
results.</p>

<p>In the gravel beds which lie near Bedford, Mr. Wyatt met with
flints resembling the principal types of those of Amiens and Abbeville;
they were found in company with the remains of the mammoth,
rhinoceros, hippopotamus, ox, horse, and deer. Similar discoveries were
made in Suffolk, Kent, Hertfordshire, Hampshire, Wiltshire, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Some time after his return from Abbeville, Mr. Evans, going round
the museum of the Society of Antiquaries in London, found in their
rooms some specimens exactly similar to those in the collection of
Boucher de Perthes. On making inquiries as to their origin, he found
that they had been obtained from the gravel at Hoxne by Mr. Frere,
who had collected them there, together with the bones of extinct
animals, all of which he had presented to the museum, after having
given a description of them in the 'Archæologia' of 1800, with this
remark: ... "Fabricated and used by a people who had not the use
of metals.... The situation in which these weapons were found may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"> [Pg 13]</a></span>
tempt us to refer them to a very remote period indeed, even beyond
that of the present world."</p>

<p>Thus, even at the commencement of the present century, they were
in possession, in England, of proofs of the co-existence of man with
the great extinct pachyderms; but, owing to neglect of the subject,
scarcely any attention had been paid to them.</p>

<p>We now come to the most remarkable and most characteristic discoveries
of this class which have ever been made. We allude to the
explorations made by M. Édouard Lartet, during the year 1860, in
the curious pre-historic human burial-place at Aurignac (Haute-Garonne).</p>

<p>Going down the hill on the road leading from Aurignac, after
proceeding about a mile, we come to the point where, on the other
side of the dale, the ridge of the hill called <i>Fajoles</i> rises, not more
than 65 feet above a rivulet. We then may notice, on the
northern slope of this eminence, an escarpment of the rock, by the
side of which there is a kind of niche about six feet deep, the arched
opening of it facing towards the north-west. This little cave is situated
forty-two feet above the rivulet. Below, the calcareous soil slopes
down towards the stream.</p>

<p>The discovery of this hollow, which is now cleared out, was made
entirely by chance. It was hidden by a mass of <i>débris</i> of rock and
vegetable-earth which had crumbled down; it had, in fact, only been
known as a rabbits' hole. In 1842, an excavating labourer, named
Bonnemaison, took it into his head one day to thrust his arm into
this hole, and out of it he drew forth a large bone. Being rather
curious to search into the mystery, he made an excavation in the slope
below the hole, and, after some hours' labour, came upon a slab of
sandstone which closed up an arched opening. Behind the slab of
stone, he discovered a hollow in which a quantity of human bones
were stored up.</p>

<p>It was not long before the news of this discovery was spread far
and wide. Crowds of curious visitors flocked to the spot, and many
endeavoured to explain the origin of these human remains, the immense
antiquity of which was attested by their excessive fragility. The old
inhabitants of the locality took it into their heads to recall to recollection
a band of coiners and robbers who, half a century before, had
infested the country. This decidedly popular inquest and decision
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"> [Pg 14]</a></span>
was judged perfectly satisfactory, and everyone agreed in declaring
that the cavern which had just been brought to light was nothing but
the retreat of these malefactors, who concealed all the traces of their
crimes by hiding the bodies of their victims in this cave, which was
known to these criminals only.</p>

<p>Doctor Amiel, Mayor of Aurignac, caused all these bones to be
collected together, and they were buried in the parish cemetery.
Nevertheless, before the re-inhumation was proceeded with, he recorded
the fact that the skeletons were those of seventeen individuals of both
sexes. In addition to these skeletons, there were also found in the
cave a number of little discs, or flat rings, formed of the shell of a
species of cockle (<i>cardium</i>). Flat rings altogether similar to these
are not at all unfrequent in the necklaces and other ornanments of
Assyrian antiquity found in Nineveh.</p>

<p>Eighteen years after this event, that is in 1860, M. Édouard Lartet
paid a visit to Aurignac. All the details of the above-named discovery
were related to him. After the long interval which had
elapsed, no one, not even the grave-digger himself, could recollect
the precise spot where these human remains had been buried in
the village cemetery. These precious relics were therefore lost to
science.</p>

<p>M. Lartet resolved, however, to set on foot some excavations in the
cave from which they had been taken, and he soon found himself in
possession of unhoped-for treasures. The floor of the cavern itself
had remained intact, and was covered with a layer of "made ground"
mixed with fragments of stone. Outside this same cave M. Lartet
discovered a bed of ashes and charcoal, which, however, did not extend
to the interior. This bed was covered with "made ground" of an
ossiferous and vegetable character. Inside the cave, the ground contained
bones of the bear, the fox, the reindeer, the bison, the horse,
&amp;c., all intermingled with numerous relics of human industry, such as
implements made of stag or reindeer's-horn, carefully pointed at one
end and bevelled off at the other&mdash;a pierced handle of reindeer's-horn&mdash;flint
knives and weapons of different kinds; lastly, a canine-tooth
of a bear, roughly carved in the shape of a bird's head and pierced
with a hole, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The excavations, having been carried to a lower level, brought to
light the remains of the bear, the wild-cat, the cave-hyæna, the wolf,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"> [Pg 15]</a></span>
the mammoth, the horse, the stag, the reindeer, the ox, the rhinoceros,
&amp;c., &amp;c. It was, in fact, a complete Noah's ark. These bones were
all broken lengthwise, and some of them were carbonised. <i>Striæ</i> and
notches were found on them, which could only have been made by
cutting instruments.</p>

<p>M. Lartet, after long and patient investigations, came to the conclusion
that the cave of Aurignac was a human burial-place, contemporary
with the mammoth, the <i>Rhinocerus tichorhinus</i>, and other
great mammals of the quarternary epoch.</p>

<p>The mode in which the long bones were broken shows that they
had been cracked with a view of extracting the marrow; and the
notches on them prove that the flesh had been cut off them with sharp
instruments. The ashes point to the existence of a fire, in which
some of these bones had been burnt. Men must have resorted to
this cavern in order to fulfil certain funereal rites. The weapons
and animals' bones must have been deposited there in virtue of
some funereal dedication, of which numerous instances are found in
Druidical or Celtic monuments and in Gallic tombs.</p>

<p>Such are the valuable discoveries, and such the new facts which
were the result of the investigations made by M. Édouard Lartet
in the cave of Aurignac. In point of fact, they left no doubt
whatever as to the co-existence of man with the great antediluvian
animals.</p>

<p>In 1862, Doctor Felix Garrigou, of Tarrascon, a distinguished
geologist, published the results of the researches which he, in conjunction
with MM. Rames and Filhol, had made in the caverns of
Ariége. These explorers found the lower jaw-bones of the great bear,
which, with their sharp and projecting canine-tooth, had been employed
by man as an offensive weapon, almost in the same way as Samson
used the jaw-bone of an ass in fighting with the Philistines.</p>

<p>"It was principally," says M. Garrigou, "in the caves of Lombrives,
Lherm, Bouicheta, and Maz-d'Azil that we found the jaw-bones of the
great bear and the cave-lion, which were acknowledged to have been
wrought by the hand of man, not only by us, but also by the numerous
French and English <i>savants</i> who examined them and asked for some
of them to place in their collections. The number of these jaw-bones
now reaches to more than a hundred. Furnished, as they are, with
an immense canine-tooth, and carved so as to give greater facility
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"> [Pg 16]</a></span>
for grasping them, they must have formed, when in a fresh state,
formidable weapons in the hands of primitive man....</p>

<p>"These animals belong to species which are now extinct, and if
their bones while still in a fresh state (since they were gnawed by
hyænas) were used as weapons, man must have been contemporary
with them."</p>

<p>In the cave of Bruniquel (Tarn-et-Garonne), which was visited in
1862 by MM. Garrigou and Filhol, and other <i>savants</i>, there were
found, under a very hard osseous <i>breccia</i>, an ancient fire-hearth with
ashes and charcoal, the broken and calcined bones of ruminants of
various extinct species, flint flakes used as knives, facetted nuclei,
and both triangular and quadrangular arrow-heads of great distinctness,
utensils in stags' horn and bone&mdash;in short, everything which could
prove the former presence of primitive man.</p>

<p>About three-quarters of a mile below the cave there was subsequently
found, at a depth of about twenty feet, an osseous <i>breccia</i>
similar to the first, and likewise containing broken bones and a
series of ancient fire-hearths filled with ashes and objects of antediluvian
industry. Bones, teeth, and flints were to be collected in
bushels.</p>

<p>At the commencement of 1863, M. Garrigou presented to the
Geological Society of France the objects which had been found in the
caves of Lherm and Bouicheta, and the Abbé Bourgeois published
some remarks on the wrought flints from the <i>diluvium</i> of Pont-levoy.</p>

<p>This, therefore, was the position of the question in respect to fossil
man, when in 1863, the scientific world were made acquainted with
the fact of the discovery of a human jaw-bone in the diluvial beds of
Moulin-Quignon, near Abbeville. We will relate the circumstances
attending this memorable discovery.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of March, 1863, an excavator who was working in
the sand-quarries at Moulin-Quignon brought to Boucher de Perthes
at Abbeville, a flint hatchet and a small fragment of bone which he
had just picked up. Having cleaned off the earthy coat which
covered it, Boucher de Perthes recognised this bone to be a human
molar. He immediately visited the spot, and assured himself that the
locality where these objects had been found was an argilo-ferruginous
vein, impregnated with some colouring matter which appeared to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"> [Pg 17]</a></span>
contain organic remains. This layer formed a portion of a <i>virgin</i>
bed, as it is called by geologists, that is, without any infiltration or
secondary introduction.</p>

<p>On the 28th of March another excavator brought to Boucher de
Perthes a second human tooth, remarking at the same time, "that
something resembling a bone was just then to be seen in the sand."
Boucher de Perthes immediately repaired to the spot, and in the
presence of MM. Dimpré the elder and younger, and several members
of the Abbeville <i>Société d'Emulation</i>, he personally extracted from
the soil the half of a human lower jaw-bone, covered with an earthy
crust. A few inches from this, a flint hatchet was discovered,
covered with the same black patina as the jaw-bone. The level
where it was found was about fifteen feet below the surface of the
ground.</p>

<p>After this event was duly announced, a considerable number of
geologists flocked to Abbeville, about the middle of the month
of April. The Abbé Bourgeois, MM. Brady-Buteux, Carpenter,
Falconer, &amp;c., came one after the other, to verify the locality from
which the human jaw-bone had been extracted. All were fully convinced
of the intact state of the bed and the high antiquity of the
bone which had been found.</p>

<p>Boucher de Perthes also discovered in the same bed of gravel two
mammoth's teeth, and a certain number of wrought hatchets. Finally,
he found among the bones which had been taken from the Menchecourt
quarries in the early part of April, a fragment of another jaw-bone
and six separate teeth, which were recognised by Dr. Falconer
to be also human.</p>

<p>The jaw-bone found at Moulin-Quignon is very well preserved.
It is rather small in size, and appears to have belonged to an aged
individual of small stature. It does not possess that ferocious aspect
which is noticed in the jaw-bones of certain of the existing human
races. The obliquity of the molar-tooth may be explained by supposing
some accident, for the molar which stood next had fallen out during
the lifetime of the individual, leaving a gap which favoured the
obliquity of the tooth which remained in the jaw. This peculiarity
is found also in several of the human heads in the collection of the
Museum of Natural History in Paris.</p>

<p class="topspace2">The jaw-bone of the man of Moulin-Quignon, which is represented

here (fig. 1) in its natural size, and drawn from the object itself,
which is preserved in the Anthropological Gallery of the Museum of
Natural History of Paris, does not show any decided points of
difference when compared with those of individuals of existing races.</p>

<p>The same conclusion was arrived at as the result of the comparative
examination which was made of the jaw-bones found by
MM. Lartet and De Vibraye in the caves of Aurignac and Arcy; the
latter remains were studied by M. Quatrefages in conjunction with
Pruner-Bey, formerly physician to the Viceroy of Egypt, and one of
the most distinguished French anthropologists.</p>

<p>On the 20th of April, 1863, M. de Quatrefages announced to the
institute the discovery which had been made by Boucher de Perthes,
and he presented to the above-named learned body the interesting
object itself, which had been sent from Abbeville.</p>

<p>When the news of this discovery arrived in England it produced
no slight sensation.</p>

<p>Some of the English <i>savants</i> who had more specially devoted their
attention to the study of this question, such as Messrs. Christy,
Falconer, Carpenter, and Busk, went over to France, and in conjunction
with Boucher de Perthes and several members of the
Académie des Sciences of Paris, examined the exact locality in which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"> [Pg 19]</a></span>
the hatchets and the human jaw-bone had been found; they unanimously
agreed in recognising the correctness of the conclusions arrived
at by the indefatigable geologist of Abbeville.<a name="fnanchor_5"
id="fnanchor_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>This discovery of the hatchets and the human jaw-bone in the
quaternary beds of Moulin-Quignon completed the demonstration of
an idea already supported by an important mass of evidence. Setting
aside its own special value, this discovery, added to so many others,
could not fail to carry conviction into most minds. From this time
forth the doctrine of the high antiquity of the human race became
an acknowledged idea in the scientific world.</p>

<p>Before closing our historical sketch, we shall have to ask, what was
the precise geological epoch to which we shall have to carry back the
date of man's first appearance on this our earth.</p>

<p>The beds which are anterior to the present period, the series of
which forms the solid crust of our globe, have been divided, as is well
known, into five groups, corresponding to the same number of periods
of the physical development of the earth. These are in their order of
age: the <i>primitive rocks</i>, the <i>transition rocks</i>, the <i>secondary rocks</i>,
the <i>tertiary</i> and <i>quaternary rocks</i>. Each of these epochs must have
embraced an immense lapse of time, since it has radically exhausted
the generation both of animals and plants which was peculiar to it.
Some idea may be formed of the extreme slowness with which organic
creatures modify their character, when we take into consideration that
our contemporary <i>fauna</i>, that is to say, the collection of animals
of every country which belong to the geological period in which we
exist, has undergone little, if any, alteration during the thousands
of years that it has been in being.</p>

<p>Is it possible for us to date the appearance of the human race in
those prodigiously-remote epochs which correspond with the primitive,
the transition, or the secondary rocks? Evidently no! Is it possible,
indeed, to fix this date in the epoch of the tertiary rocks? Some
geologists have fancied that they could find traces of the presence of
man in these tertiary rocks (the miocene and pliocene). But this is
an opinion in which we, at least, cannot make up our minds to agree.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"> [Pg 20]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1863, M. Desnoyers found in the upper strata of the tertiary
beds (pliocene) at Saint-Prest, in the department of Eure, certain bones
belonging to various extinct animal species; among others those of an
elephant (<i>Elephas meridionalis</i>), an animal which did not form a part
of the quaternary <i>fauna</i>. On most of these bones he ascertained the
existence of cuts, or notches, which, in his opinion, must have been
produced by flint implements. These indications, according to M.
Desnoyers, are signs of the existence of man in the tertiary epoch.</p>

<p>This opinion, however, Sir Charles Lyell hesitates to accept. Moreover,
we could hardly depend upon an accident so insignificant as
that of a few cuts or notches made upon a bone, in order to establish
a fact so important as that of the high antiquity of man. We
must also state that it is a matter of question whether the beds
which contained these notched bones really belong to the tertiary
group.</p>

<p>The beds which correspond to the quaternary epoch are, therefore,
those in which we find unexceptionable evidence of the existence of man.
Consequently, in the quaternary epoch which preceded the existing
geological period, we must place the date of the first appearance of
mankind upon the earth.</p>

<p>If the purpose is entertained of discussing, with any degree of
certainty, the history of the earliest days of the human race&mdash;a
subject which as yet is a difficult one&mdash;it is requisite that the long
interval should be divided into a certain number of periods. The
science of primitive man is one so recently entered upon, that those
authors who have written upon the point can hardly be said to have
properly discussed and agreed upon a rational scheme of classification.
We shall, in this work, adopt the classification proposed by M. Édouard
Lartet, which, too, has been adopted in that portion of the museum of
Saint-Germain which is devoted to pre-historic antiquities. Following
this course, we shall divide the history of primitive mankind into two
great periods:</p>

<p>1st. The Stone Age;</p>

<p>2nd. The Metal Age.</p>

<p>These two principal periods must also be subdivided in the following
mode. The "Stone Age" will embrace three epochs:</p>

<p>1st. The epoch of extinct animals (or of the great cave-bear and
the mammoth).</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"> [Pg 21]</a></span></p>
<p>2nd. The epoch of migrated existing animals (or the reindeer
epoch).</p>

<p>3rd. The epoch of domesticated existing animals (or the polished-stone
epoch).</p>

<p>The "Metal Age" may also be divided into two periods:</p>

<p>1st. The Bronze Epoch;</p>

<p>2nd. The Iron Epoch.</p>

<p>The following synoptical table will perhaps bring more clearly
before the eyes of our readers this mode of classification, which has, at
least, the merit of enabling us to make a clear and simple statement
of the very incongruous facts which make up the history of primitive
man:</p>

<div class="chapsum">
The earliest Men&mdash;The type of Man in the Epoch of Animals of extinct Species&mdash;Origin
of Man&mdash;Refutation of the Theory which derives the Human Species
from the Ape.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span> must have lived during the time in which the last representatives
of the ancient animal creation&mdash;the mammoth, the great bear, the
cave-hyæna, the <i>Rhinoceros tichorinus</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;were still in existence. It
is this earliest period of man's history which we are now about to
enter upon.</p>

<p>We have no knowledge of a precise nature with regard to man at
the period of his first appearance on the globe. How did he appear
upon the earth, and in what spot can we mark out the earliest traces
of him? Did he first come into being in that part of the world which
we now call Europe, or is it the fact that he made his way to this
quarter of our hemisphere, having first seen the light on the great
plateaux of Central Asia?</p>

<p>This latter opinion is the one generally accepted. In the work
which will follow the present volume we shall see, when speaking
of the various races of man, that the majority of naturalists admit
nowadays one common centre of creation for all mankind. Man, no
doubt, first came into being on the great plateaux of Central Asia, and
thence was distributed over all the various habitable portions of our
globe. The action of climate and the influences of the locality which
he inhabited have, therefore, determined the formation of the different
races&mdash;white, black, yellow, and red&mdash;which now exist with all their
infinite subdivisions.</p>

<p>But there is another question which arises, to which it is necessary
to give an immediate answer, for it has been and is incessantly agitated
with a degree of vehemence which may be explained by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"> [Pg 26]</a></span>
nature of the discussion being of so profoundly personal a character as
regards all of us: Was man created by God complete in all parts, and
is the human type independent of the type of the animals which
existed before him? Or, on the contrary, are we compelled to admit
that man, by insensible transformations, and gradual improvements
and developments, is derived from some other animal species, and particularly
that of the ape?</p>

<p>This latter opinion was maintained at the commencement of the
present century by the French naturalist, de Lamarck, who laid down
his views very plainly in his work entitled 'Philosophie Zoologique.'
The same theory has again been taken up in our own time, and has
been developed, with no small supply of facts on which it might
appear to be based, by a number of scientific men, among whom
we may mention Professor Carl Vogt in Switzerland, and Professor
Huxley in England.</p>

<p>We strongly repudiate any doctrine of this kind. In endeavouring
to establish the fact that man is nothing more than a developed and
improved ape, an orang-outang or a gorilla, somewhat elevated in
dignity, the arguments are confined to an appeal to anatomical considerations.
The skull of the ape is compared with that of primitive
man, and certain characteristics of analogy, more or less real, being
found to exist between the two bony cases, the conclusion has been
arrived at that there has been a gradual blending between the type of
the ape and that of man.</p>

<p>We may observe, in the first place, that these analogies have been
very much exaggerated, and that they fail to stand their ground
in the face of a thorough examination of the facts. Only look at
the skulls which have been found in the tombs belonging to the
stone age, the so-called <i>Borreby skull</i> for instance&mdash;examine the
human jaw-bone from Moulin-Quignon, the Meilen skull, &amp;c., and
you will be surprised to see that they differ very little in appearance
from the skulls of existing man. One would really imagine, from
what is said by the partisans of Lamarck's theory, that primitive man
possessed the projecting jaw of the ape, or at least that of the negro.
We are astonished, therefore, when we ascertain that, on the contrary,
the skull of the man of the stone age is almost entirely similar in
appearance to those of the existing Caucasian species. Special study
is, indeed, required in order to distinguish one from the other.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"> [Pg 27]</a></span></p>
<p>If we place side by side the skull of a man belonging to the Stone
Age, and the skulls of the principal apes of large size, these dissimilarities
cannot fail to be obvious. No other elements of comparison,
beyond merely looking at them, seem to be requisite to enable us to
refute the doctrine of this debased origin of mankind.</p>

<p>The figure annexed represents the skull of a man belonging to the
stone age, found in Denmark; to this skull, which is known by the
name of the Borreby skull, we shall have to allude again in the
course of the present work; fig. 3 represents the skull of a gorilla;
fig. 4 that of an orang-outang; fig. 5 that of the <i>Cynocephalus</i>
ape; fig. 6 that of the <i>Macacus</i>. Place the representation of the
skull found in Denmark in juxtaposition with these ill-favoured
animal masks, and then let the reader draw his own inference, without
pre-occupying his mind with the allegations of certain anatomists
imbued with contrary ideas.</p>

<p class="topspace2">Finding themselves beaten as regards the skulls, the advocates of
transmutation next appeal to the bones. With this aim, they exhibit
to us certain similarities of arrangement existing between the skeleton
of the ape and that of primitive man. Such, for instance, is the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"> [Pg 28]</a></span>
longitudinal ridge which exists on the thigh-bone, which is as
prominent in primitive man as in the ape. Such, also, is the fibula,
which is very stout in primitive man, just as in the ape, but is rather
slender in the man of the present period.</p>

<p>When we are fully aware how the form of the skeleton is modified
by the kind of life which is led, in men just as in animals, we cannot
be astonished at finding that certain organs assume a much higher
development in those individuals who put them to frequent and violent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"> [Pg 29]</a></span>
use, than in others who leave these same organs in a state of comparative
repose.</p>

<p>If it be a fact that the man of the epoch of the great bear and the
mammoth had a more robust leg, and a more largely developed thigh-bone
than most of the races of existing man, the reason simply is, that
his savage life, which was spent in the midst of the wild beasts of the
forest, compelled him to make violent exertions, which increased the
size of these portions of his body.</p>


<p>Thus it is found that great walkers have a bulky calf, and persons
leading a sedentary life have slender legs. These variations in the
structure of the skeleton are owing, therefore, to nothing but a difference
in the mode of life.</p>

<p>Why is it, however, that the skeleton is the only point taken into
consideration when analogies are sought for between man and any
species of animal? If equal investigation were given to other
organs, we should arrive at a conclusion which would prove how unreasonable
comparisons of this kind are. In fact, if man possesses
the osseous structure of the ape, he has also the anatomical structure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"> [Pg 30]</a></span>
of many other animals, as far as regards several organs. Are not the
viscera of the digestive system the same, and are they not organised
on the same plan in man as in the carnivorous animals? As the result
of this, would you say that man is derived from the tiger, that he is
nothing but an improved and developed lion, a cat transmuted into a
man? We may, however, just as plausibly draw this inference, unless
we content ourselves with devoting our attention to the skeleton
alone, which seems, indeed, to be the only part of the individual in
which we are to interest ourselves, for what reason we know not.</p>

<p>But, in point of fact, this kind of anatomy is pitiable. Is there
nothing in man but bones? Do the skeleton and the viscera
make up the entire sum of the human being? What will you say,
then, ye blind rhetoricians, about the faculty of intelligence as manifested
in the gift of speech? Intelligence and speech, these are really
the attributes which constitute man; these are the qualities which
make him the most complete being in creation, and the most privileged
of God's creatures. Show me an ape who can speak, and then I will
agree with you in recognising it as a fact that man is nothing but an
improved ape! Show me an ape who can make flint hatchets and
arrow-heads, who can light a fire and cook his food, who, in short, can
act like an intelligent creature&mdash;then, and then only, I am ready
to confess that I am nothing more than an orang-outang revised and
corrected.</p>

<p>It is not, however, our desire to speak of a question which has
been the subject of so much controversy as that of the anatomical
resemblance between the ape and the man without thoroughly
entering into it; we have, indeed, no wish to shun the discussion of
the point. On the present occasion, we shall appeal to the opinion
of a <i>savant</i> perfectly qualified in such matters; we allude to M. de
Quatrefages, Professor of Anthropology in the Museum of Natural
History at Paris.</p>

<p>M. de Quatrefages, in his work entitled 'Rapport sur le Progrès
de l'Anthropologie,' published in 1868, has entered rather fully into
the question whether man is descended from the ape or not. He
has summed up the contents of a multitude of contemporary works on
this subject, and has laid down his opinion&mdash;the perfect impossibility,
in an anatomical point of view, of this strange and repugnant
genealogy.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"> [Pg 31]</a></span></p>
<p>The following extract from his work will be sufficient to make
our readers acquainted with the ideas of the learned Professor of
Anthropology with regard to the question which we are now considering:</p>

<p>"Man and apes in general," says M. de Quatrefages, "present a
most striking contrast&mdash;a contrast on which Vicq-d'Azyr, Lawrence,
and M. Serres have dwelt in detail for some considerable time
past. The former is a <i>walking animal</i>, who walks upon his hind
legs; all apes are <i>climbing animals</i>. The whole of the locomotive
system in the two groups bears the stamp of these two very different
intentions; the two types, in fact, are perfectly distinct.</p>

<p>"The very remarkable works of Duvernoy on the 'Gorilla,' and
of MM. Gratiolet and Alix on the 'Chimpanzee,' have fully confirmed
this result as regards the anthropomorphous apes&mdash;a result
very important, from whatever point of view it is looked at, but of
still greater value to any one who wishes to apply <i>logically</i> Darwin's
idea. These recent investigations prove, in fact, that the ape type,
however highly it may be developed, loses nothing of its fundamental
character, and remains always perfectly distinct from the type
of man; the latter, therefore, cannot have taken its rise from the
former.</p>

<p>"Darwin's doctrine, when rationally adapted to the fact of the
appearance of man, would lead us to the following results:</p>

<p>"We are acquainted with a large number of terms in the Simian
series. We see it branching out into secondary series all leading
up to anthropomorphous apes, which are not members of one and
the same family, but corresponding superior <i>terms</i> of three distinct
families (Gratiolet). In spite of the secondary modifications involved
by the developments of the same natural qualities, the orang, the
gorilla, and the chimpanzee remain none the less fundamentally mere
<i>apes</i> and <i>climbers</i> (Duvernoy, Gratiolet, and Alix). Man, consequently,
in whom everything shows that he is a <i>walker</i>, cannot
belong to any one of these series; he can only be the higher term
of a distinct series, the other representatives of which have disappeared,
or, up to the present time, have evaded our search. Man
and the anthropomorphous apes are the final terms of two series,
which commence to diverge at the very latest as soon as the lowest
of the apes appear upon the earth.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"> [Pg 32]</a></span></p>
<p>"This is really the way in which a true disciple of Darwin must
reason, even if he solely took into account the <i>external morphological
characteristics</i> and the <i>anatomical characteristics</i> which are the expression
of the former in the adult animal.</p>

<p>"Will it be said that when the degree of organisation manifested
in the anthropomorphous apes had been once arrived at, the organism
underwent a new impulse and became adapted for walking? This
would be, in fact, adding a fresh hypothesis, and its promoters
would not be in a position to appeal to the organised gradation presented
by the quadrumanous order as a whole on which stress is laid
as leading to the conclusion against which I am contending: they
would be completely outside <i>Darwin's theory</i>, on which these
opinions claim to be based.</p>

<p>"Without going beyond these purely morphological considerations,
we may place, side by side, for the sake of comparison, as was done
by M. Pruner-Bey, the most striking general characteristics in man
and in the anthropomorphous apes. As the result, we ascertain this
general fact&mdash;that there exists 'an <i>inverse order</i> of the final term of
development in the sensitive and vegetative apparatus, in the systems
of locomotion and reproduction' (Pruner-Bey).</p>

<p>"In addition to this, this <i>inverse order</i> is equally exhibited in the
series of phenomena of individual development.</p>

<p>"M. Pruner-Bey has shown that this is the case with a portion of
the permanent teeth. M. Welker, in his curious studies of the
sphenoïdal angle of Virchow, arrived at a similar result. He demonstrated
that the modifications of the base of the skull, that is, of
a portion of the skeleton which stands in the most intimate relation
to the brain, take place inversely in the man and ape. This angle
diminishes from his birth in man, but, on the contrary, in the ape
it becomes more and more obtuse, so as sometimes to become entirely
extinct.</p>

<p>"But there is also another fact which is of a still more important
character: it is that this inverse course of development has been
ascertained to exist even in the brain itself. This fact, which was
pointed out by Gratiolet, and dwelt upon by him on various occasions,
has never been contested either at the <i>Société d'Anthropologie</i> or
elsewhere, and possesses an importance and significance which may
be readily comprehended.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"> [Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<p>"In man and the anthropomorphous ape, <i>when in an adult state</i>,
there exists in the mode of arrangement of the cerebral folds a
certain similarity on which much stress has been laid; but this
resemblance has been, to some extent, a source of error, for the
result is attained by an <i>inverse course of action</i>. In the ape, the
temporo-sphenoïdal convolutions, which form the middle lobe, make
their appearance, and are completed, before the anterior convolutions
which form the frontal lobe. In man, on the contrary, the frontal
convolutions are the first to appear, and those of the middle lobe
are subsequently developed.</p>

<p>"It is evident that when two organised beings follow an inverse
course in their growth, the more highly developed of the two cannot
have descended from the other by means of evolution.</p>

<p>"Embryology next adds its evidence to that of anatomy and
morphology, to show how much in error they are who have fancied
that Darwin's ideas would afford them the means of maintaining the
simial origin of man.</p>

<p>"In the face of all these facts, it may be easily understood that
anthropologists, however little in harmony they may sometimes be on
other points, are agreed on this, and have equally been led to the
conclusion that there is nothing that permits us to look at the brain
of the ape as the brain of man smitten with an arrest of development,
or, on the other hand, the brain of man as a development of that of
the ape (Gratiolet); that the study of animal organism in general,
and that of the extremities in particular, reveals, in addition to a
general plan, certain differences in shape and arrangement which
specify two altogether special and distinct adaptations, and are incompatible
with the idea of any filiation (Gratiolet and Alix); that in
their course of improvement and development, apes do not tend to
become allied to man, and conversely the human type, when in a
course of degradation, does not tend to become allied to the ape (Bert);
finally, that no possible point of transition can exist between man and
the ape, unless under the condition of inverting the laws of development
(Pruner-Bey), &amp;c.</p>

<p>"What, we may ask, is brought forward by the partisans of the
simial origin of man in opposition to these general facts, which here I
must confine myself to merely pointing out, and to the multitude of
details of which these are only the abstract?</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"> [Pg 34]</a></span></p>
<p>"I have done my best to seek out the proofs alleged, but I everywhere
meet with nothing but the same kind of argument&mdash;exaggerations
of morphological similarities which no one denies; inferences
drawn from a few exceptional facts which are then generalised upon,
or from a few coincidences in which the relations of cause and effect
are a matter of supposition; lastly, an appeal to <i>possibilities</i> from
which conclusions of a more or less affirmative character are drawn.</p>

<p>"We will quote a few instances of this mode of reasoning.</p>

<p>"1st. The bony portion of the hand of man and of that of certain
anthropomorphous apes present marked similarities. Would it not
therefore have been possible for an almost imperceptible modification
to have ultimately led to identity?</p>

<p>"MM. Gratiolet and Alix reply to this in the negative; for the
muscular system of the thumb establishes a profound difference, and
testifies to an <i>adaptation</i> to very different uses.</p>

<p>"2nd. It is only in man and the anthropomorphous apes that the
articulation of the shoulder is so arranged as to allow of rotatory
movements. Have we not here an unmistakable resemblance?</p>

<p>"The above-named anatomists again reply in the negative; for even
if we only take the bones into account, we at once see that the movements
could not be the same; but when we come to the muscular
system, we find decisive differences again testifying to certain special
<i>adaptations</i>."</p>

<p>"These rejoinders are correct, for when <i>locomotion</i> is the matter in
question, it is evident that due consideration must be paid to the
muscles, which are the active agents in that function at least as much
as the bones, which only serve as points of attachment and are
only passive.</p>

<p>"3rd. In some of the races of man, the arch of the skull, instead of
presenting a uniform curve in the transverse direction, bends a little
towards the top of the two sides, and rises towards the median line
(New Caledonians, Australians, &amp;c.). It is asked if this is not a
preliminary step towards the bony crests which rise in this region in
some of the anthropomorphous apes?</p>

<p>"Again we reply in the negative; for, in the latter, the bony crests
arise from the walls of the skull, and do not form any part of the
arch.</p>

<p>"4th. Is it not very remarkable that we find the orang to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"> [Pg 35]</a></span>
brachycephalous, just like the Malay, whose country it inhabits, and
that the gorilla and chimpanzee are dolichocephalous like the negro?
Is not this fact a reason for our regarding the former animal as the
ancestor of the Malays, and the latter of the African nations?</p>

<p>"Even if the facts brought forward were correct, the inference
which is drawn from them would be far from satisfactory. But the
coincidence which is appealed to does not exist. In point of fact, the
orang, which is essentially a native of Borneo, lives among the Dyaks
and not among the Malays; now the Dyaks are rather dolichocephalous
than brachycephalous. With respect to gorillas being dolichocephalous,
they cannot at least be so generally; as out of <i>three</i> female
specimens of this ape which were examined, two were brachycephalous
(Pruner-Bey).</p>

<p>"5th. The brains of microcephalous individuals present a mixture
of human and simial characteristics, and point to some intermediate
conformation, which was normal at some anterior epoch, but at the
present time is only realised by an arrest of development and a fact of
atavism.</p>

<p>"Gratiolet's investigations of the brain of the ape, normal man and
small-brained individuals, have shown that the similarities pointed out
are purely fallacious. People have thought that they could detect
them, simply because they have not examined closely enough. In
the last named, the human brain is simplified; but this causes no
alteration in the <i>initial plan</i>, and this plan is not that which is ascertained
to exist in the ape. Thus Gratiolet has expressed an opinion
which no one has attempted to controvert: 'The human brain differs
the more from that of the ape the less the former is developed, and an
arrest of development could only exaggerate this natural difference....
The brains of microcephalous individuals, although often less
voluminous and less convoluted than those of the anthropomorphous
apes, do not on this account become like the latter.... The idiot,
however low he may be reduced, is not a beast; he is nothing but a
deteriorated man.'</p>

<p>"The laws of the development of the brain in the two types, laws
which I mentioned before, explain and justify this language; and the
laws of which it is the summary are a formal refutation of the comparison
which some have attempted to make between the <i>contracted
human brain</i>, and the <i>animal brain, however developed</i>.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"> [Pg 36]</a></span></p>
<p>"6th. The excavations which have been made in intact ancient
beds have brought to light skulls of ancient races of man, and these
skulls present characteristics which approximate them to the skull of
the ape. Does not this pithecoïd stamp, which is very striking on the
Neanderthal skull in particular, argue a transition from one type to
another, and consequently <i>filiation</i>?</p>

<p>"This argument is perhaps the only one which has been brought
forward with any degree of precision, and it is often recurred to.
Is it, on this account, more demonstrative? Let the reader judge for
himself.</p>

<p>"We may, in the first place, remark that Sir C. Lyell does not
venture to pronounce affirmatively as to the high antiquity of the
human remains discovered by Dr. Fuhlrott, and that he looked upon
them, at the most, as contemporary with the Engis skull, in which the
Caucasian type of head was reproduced.</p>

<p>"Let us, however, admit that the Neanderthal skull belongs to the
remote antiquity to which it has been assigned; what, then, is in
reality the significance of this skull? Is it actually a link between
the head of the man and that of the ape? And does it not find
some analogy in comparatively modern races?</p>

<p>"Many writings have been published on these questions, and, as it
appears to me, some light has gradually been thrown upon the subject.
There is no doubt that this skull is really remarkable for the
enormous size of its superciliary ridges, the length and narrowness of
the bony case, the slight elevation of the top of the skull. But these
features are found to be much less exceptional than was at first supposed,
in default of any means of instituting a just comparison; very
far, indeed, from justifying the approximation which some have
endeavoured to make, this skull is, in all its characteristics, essentially
human. Mr. Busk, in England, has pointed out the great affinity
which is established, by the prominence of the superciliary ridges and
the depression of the upper region, between certain Danish skulls from
Borreby and the Neanderthal skull. Dr. Barnard Davis has described
the still greater similarities existing between this very <i>fossil</i> and a
skull in his collection. Gratiolet forwarded to the Museum the skull
of an idiot of the present time, which was almost identical with it in
everything, although in slighter proportions, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"The following appears to me to be decisive:</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"> [Pg 37]</a></span></p>
<p>"In spite of its curious characteristics, the Neanderthal skull none
the less belonged to an individual, who, to judge by other bones which
have been found, diverged but little from the average type of the
present Germanic races, and by no means approximated to that of
the ape.</p>

<p>"Is it probable, proceeding even on the class of ideas which I am
opposing, that in a being in a state of transition between man and
the anthropomorphous apes, the body would have become entirely
human in its character, whilst the head presented its simial peculiarities?
If a fact like this is admitted, does it not render the hypothesis
absolutely worthless?</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding all the discussion to which these curious remains
have given rise, it appears to me impossible to look upon them in any
other light than as the remains of an individuality, exceptional, no
doubt, but clearly belonging to the human species, and, in addition to
this, to the Celtic race, one of the branches of our Aryan stock.
M. Pruner-Bey appears to me to have placed this fact beyond all
question by the whole mass of investigations which he has published
on this subject. The most convincing proofs are based on the very
great similarity which may be noticed in a Celtic skull taken from a
tumulus in Poitou to the skull which has become so well known and,
indeed, so celebrated owing to the writings of Doctor Schaaffhausen.
This similarity is not merely external. An internal cast taken from
one skull fits perfectly into the interior of the other. It was, therefore,
the <i>brains</i> and not merely the <i>skulls</i> which bore a resemblance
to one another. The proof appears to me to be complete, and, with
the learned author of this work, I feel no hesitation in concluding that
the Neanderthal skull is one of Celtic origin.</p>

<p>"After all, neither experience nor observation have as yet furnished
us with the slightest data with regard to man at his earliest origin.
Science, therefore, which pretends to solidity of character, must put
this problem on one side till fresh information is obtained. We really
approach nearer to the truth when we confess our ignorance than when
we attempt to disguise it either to ourselves or others.</p>

<p>"With regard to the simial origin of man, it is nothing but pure
hypothesis, or rather nothing but a mere <i>jeu d'esprit</i> which everything
proves utterly baseless, and in favour of which no solid fact has
as yet been appealed to."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"> [Pg 38]</a></span></p>
<p>In dealing with this question in a more general point of view, we
must add that the most enlightened science declares to us in unmistakable
accents, that species is immutable, and that no animal
species can be derived from another; they may change, but all bear
witness to an independent creation. This truth, which has been
developed at length by M. de Quatrefages in his numerous works, is
a definitive and scientific judgment which must decide this question
as far as regards any unprejudiced minds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> this dissertation, which was necessary to confute the theory
which gives such a degrading explanation of our origin, we must
contemplate man at the period when he was first placed upon the
earth, weak and helpless, in the midst of the inclement and wild
nature which surrounded him.</p>

<p>However much our pride may suffer by the idea, we must confess
that, at the earliest period of his existence, man could have been but
little distinguished from the brute. Care for his natural wants must
have absorbed his whole being; all his efforts must have tended to
one sole aim&mdash;that of insuring his daily subsistence.</p>

<p>At first, his only food must have been fruits and roots; for he had
not as yet invented any weapon wherewith to destroy wild animals.
If he succeeded in killing any creatures of small size he devoured them
in a raw state, and made a covering of their skins to shelter himself
against the inclemency of the weather. His pillow was a stone, his
roof was the shadow of a wide-spreading tree, or some dark cavern
which also served as a refuge against wild beasts.</p>

<p>For how many ages did this miserable state last? No one can
tell. Man is an improvable being, and indefinite progress is the law
of his existence. Improvement is his supreme attribute; and this it
is which gives him the pre-eminence over all the creatures which surround
him. But how wavering must have been his first steps in
advance, and how many efforts must have been given to the earliest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"> [Pg 40]</a></span>
creation of his mind and to the first work of his hands&mdash;doubtless
some shapeless attempt in which we nowadays, perhaps, should
have some difficulty in recognising the work of any intelligent
being!</p>

<p>Towards the commencement of the quaternary epoch, a great
natural phenomenon took place in Europe. Under the influence of
numerous and varied causes, which up to the present time have not
been fully recognised, a great portion of Europe became covered with
ice, on the one hand, making its way from the poles down to the
most southern latitudes, and, on the other, descending into the plains
from the summits of the highest mountain chains. Ice and ice-fields
assumed a most considerable extension. As all the lower parts of the
continent were covered by the sea, there were only a few plateaux
which could afford a refuge to man and animals flying from this
deadly cold. Such was the <i>Glacial Period</i>, which produced the annihilation
of so many generations of animals, and must have equally
affected man himself, so ill-defended against this universal and sudden
winter.</p>

<p>Man, however, was enabled to resist the attacks of revolted nature.
Without doubt, in this unhappy period, he must have made but little
progress, even if his intellectual development were not completely
stopped. At all events, the human species did not perish. The
glacial period came to an end, the ice-fields shrank back to their
original limits, and Nature reassumed its primitive aspect.</p>

<p>When the ice had gradually retired into the more northern latitudes,
and had become confined to the higher summits, a new generation of
animals&mdash;another <i>fauna</i>, as naturalists call it&mdash;made its appearance on
the globe. This group of animals, which had newly come into being,
differed much from those that had disappeared in the glacial cataclysm.
Let us cast an inquiring glance on these strange and now extinct
creatures.</p>

<p>First we have the mammoth (<i>Elephas primigenius</i>), or the woolly-haired
and maned elephant, carcases of which were found, entire and
in good preservation, in the ice on the coasts of Siberia. Next comes
the rhinoceros with a complete nasal septum (<i>Rhinoceros tichorhinus</i>),
likewise clad in a warm and soft fur, the nose of which is surmounted
with a remarkable pair of horns. Then follow several species of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"> [Pg 41]</a></span>
hippopotamus, which come as far north as the rivers of England and
Russia; a bear of great size inhabiting caverns (<i>Ursus spelæus</i>), and
presenting a projecting forehead and a large-sized skull; the cave
lion or tiger (<i>Felis spelæa</i>), which much surpassed in strength the
same animals of the existing species; various kinds of hyænas
(<i>Hyæna spelæa</i>), much stronger than those of our epoch; the bison
or aurochs (<i>Biso europæus</i>), which still exists in Poland; the great
ox, the Urus of the ancients (<i>Bos primigenius</i>); the gigantic Irish
elk (<i>Megaceros hibernicus</i>), the horns of which attained to surprising
dimensions. Other animals made their appearance at the same epoch,
but they are too numerous to mention; among them were some of
the Rodent family. Almost all these species are now extinct, but man
certainly existed in the midst of them.</p>

<p>The mammoth, elephant, rhinoceros, stag, and hippopotamus were
then in the habit of roaming over Europe in immense herds, just as
some of these animals still do in the interior of Africa. These
animals must have had their favourite haunts&mdash;spots where they
assembled together in thousands; or else it would be difficult to
account for the countless numbers of bones which are found accumulated
at the same spot.</p>

<p>Before these formidable bands, man could dream of nothing but
flight. It was only with some isolated animal that he could dare to
engage in a more or less unequal conflict. Farther on in our work,
we shall see how he began to fabricate some rough weapons, with a
view of attacking his mighty enemies.</p>

<p>The first important step which man made in the path of progress
was the acquisition of fire. In all probability, man came to the
knowledge of it by accident, either by meeting with some substance
which had been set on fire by lightning or volcanic heat, or by the
friction of pieces of wood setting a light to some very inflammable
matter.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord"><a name="i_066.jpg" id="i_066.jpg"></a> <img src="images/i_066.jpg"
alt="Production of fire"  />
<div class="caption">Fig. 7.&mdash;The Production of Fire.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">In order to obtain fire, man of the quaternary epoch may have
employed the same means as those made use of by the American
aborigines, at the time when Christopher Columbus first fell in with
them on the shores of the New World&mdash;means which savage nations
existing at the present day still put in practice. He rubbed two
pieces of dry wood one against the other, or turned round and round
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"> [Pg 42]</a></span>
with great rapidity a stick sharpened to a point, having placed the end
of it in a hole made in the trunk of a very dry tree (fig. 7).</p>

<p>As among the savages of the present day we find certain elementary
mechanisms adapted to facilitate the production of fire, it is not impossible
that these same means were practised at an early period
of the human race. It would take a considerable time to set light to
two pieces of dry wood by merely rubbing them against one another;
but if a bow be made use of, that is, the chord of an arc fixed firmly
on a handle, so as to give a rapid revolution to a cylindrical rod of
wood ending in a point which entered into a small hole made in a
board, the board may be set on fire in a few minutes. Such a
mode of obtaining fire may have been made use of by the men who
lived in the same epoch with the mammoth and other animals, the
species of which are now extinct.</p>

<p>The first rudiments of combustion having been obtained, so as to
serve, during the daytime, for the purposes of warmth and cooking
food, and during the night, for giving light, how was the fire to be
kept up? Wood from the trees that grew in the district, or from
those which were cast up by the currents of the rivers or sea; inflammable
mineral oils; resin obtained from coniferous trees; the fat
and grease of wild animals; oil extracted from the great cetaceans;&mdash;all
these substances must have assisted in maintaining combustion,
for the purposes both of warmth and light. The only fuel which the
Esquimaux of the present day have either to warm their huts or light
them during the long nights of their gloomy climate, is the oil of the
whale and seal, which, burnt in a lamp with a short wick, serves both
to cook their food and also to warm and illumine their huts.</p>

<p>Even, nowadays, in the Black Forest (Duchy of Baden), instead
of candles, long splinters of very dry beech are sometimes made use of,
which are fixed in a horizontal position at one end and lighted at the
other. This forms an economical lamp, which is really not to be
despised.</p>

<p>We have also heard of the very original method which is resorted
to by the inhabitants of the Faroe Isles in the northern seas of
Europe, in order to warm and light up their huts. This method
consists in taking advantage of the fat and greasy condition of the
young Stormy Petrel (Mother Carey's Chicken), so as to convert its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"> [Pg 43]</a></span>
body into a regular lamp. All that is necessary is to draw a wick
through its body, projecting at the beak, which when lighted causes
this really animal candle to throw out an excellent light until the last
greasy morsel of the bird is consumed.</p>

<p>This bird is also used by the natives of the Isles as a natural fuel
to keep up their fires and cook other birds.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the means which were made use of by
primitive man in order to procure fire, either the simple friction of
two pieces of wood one against the other, continued for a long time,
the <i>bow</i>, or merely a stick turning round rapidly by the action of the
hand, without any kind of mechanism&mdash;it is certain that the acquisition
of fire must be classed amongst the most beautiful and valuable
discoveries which mankind has made. Fire must have put an end to
the weariness of the long nights. In the presence of fire, the darkness
of the holes and caverns in which man made his first retreat,
must have vanished away. With the aid of fire, the most rigorous
climates became habitable, and the damp which impregnated the
body of man or his rough garments, made of the skin of the bear or
some long-haired ruminant, could be evaporated. With fire near
them, the danger arising from ferocious beasts must have much
diminished; for a general instinct leads wild animals to dread the
light and the heat of a fire. Buried, as they were, in the midst
of forests infested with wild beasts, primitive men might, by means of
a fire kept alight during the night, sleep in peace without being disturbed
by the attacks of the huge wild beasts which prowled about
all round them.</p>

<p>Fire, too, gave the first starting-point to man's industry. It
afforded means to the earliest inhabitants of the earth for felling
trees, for procuring charcoal, for hardening wood for the manufacture
of their rudimentary implements, and for baking their primitive
pottery.</p>

<p>Thus, as soon as man had at his disposal the means for producing
artificial heat, his position began to improve, and the kindly flame of
the hearth became the first centre round which the family circle was
constituted.</p>

<p>Ere long man felt the need of strengthening his natural powers
against the attacks of wild beasts. At the same time he desired to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"> [Pg 44]</a></span>
be able to make his prey some of the more peaceable animals, such as
the stag, the smaller kinds of ruminants, and the horse. Then it
was that he began to manufacture weapons.</p>

<p>He had remarked, spread about the surface of the ground, certain
flints, with sharp corners and cutting edges. These he gathered up,
and by the means of other stones of a rather tougher nature, he
broke off from them pieces, which he fashioned roughly in the
shape of a hatchet or hammer. He fixed these splinters into split
sticks, by way of a handle, and firmly bound them in their places
with the tendons of an animal or the strong stalks of some dried
plant. With this weapon, he could, if he pleased, strike his prey
at a distance.</p>

<p>When man had invented the bow and chipped out flint arrow-heads,
he was enabled to arrest the progress of the swiftest animal in
the midst of his flight.</p>

<p>Since the time when the investigations with regard to primitive
man have been set on foot in all countries, and have been energetically
prosecuted, enormous quantities have been found of these
chipped flints, arrow-heads, and various stone implements, which
archæologists designate by the common denomination of <i>hatchets</i>,
in default of being able, in some cases, to distinguish the special use
for which they had been employed. Before going any further, it
will be necessary to enter into some details with regard to these flint
implements&mdash;objects which are altogether characteristic of the earliest
ages of civilisation.</p>

<p>For a long time past chipped stones of a somewhat similar character
have been met with here and there in several countries, sometimes
on the surface of, and sometimes buried deeply in, the ground;
but no one understood what their significance was. If the common
people ever distinguished them from ordinary stones, they attached
to them some superstitious belief. Sometimes they called them
"thunder-stones," because they attributed to them the power of
preserving from lightning those who were in possession of them. It
was not until the middle of the present century that naturalists and
archæologists began to comprehend the full advantage which might
be derived from the examination of these chipped stones, in reconstructing
the lineaments of the earliest of the human race and in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"> [Pg 45]</a></span>
penetrating, up to a certain point, into their manners, customs, and
industry. These stone-hatchets and arrow-heads are, therefore, very
plentiful in the present day in collections of antiquities and cabinets of
natural history.</p>

<p>Most of these objects which are found in Europe are made of
flint, and this circumstance may be easily explained. Flint must
have been preferred as a material, on account both of its hardness
and its mode of cleavage, which may be so readily adapted to the
will of the workman. One hard blow, skilfully applied, is sufficient
to break off, by the mere shock, a sharp-edged flake of a blade-like
shape. These sharp-edged blades of silex might serve as knives.
Certainly they would not last long in use, for they are very easily
notched; but primitive men must have been singularly skilful in
making them.</p>

<p>Although the shapes of these stone implements are very varied,
they may all be classed under a certain number of prevailing types;
and these types are to be found in very different countries. The flint
hatchets are at first very simple although irregular in their shape;
but they gradually manifest a much larger amount of talent exhibited
in their manufacture, and a better judgment is shown in adapting
them to the special uses for which they were intended. The progress
of the human intellect is written in ineffaceable characters on these
tablets of stone, which, defended as they were, by a thick layer of
earth, bid defiance to the injuries of time.</p>

<p>Let us not despise these first and feeble efforts of our primitive
forefathers, for they mark the date of the starting-point of manufactures
and the arts. If the men of the stone age had not persevered
in their efforts, we, their descendants, should never have
possessed either our palaces or our masterpieces of painting and
sculpture. As Boucher de Perthes says, "The first man who struck
one pebble against another to make some requisite alteration in its
form, gave the first blow of the chisel which has resulted in producing
the Minerva and all the sculpture of the Parthenon."</p>

<p>Archæologists who have devoted their energies to investigating
the earliest monuments of human industry, have found it necessary
to be on their guard against certain errors, or rather wilful deceptions,
which might readily pervert their judgment and deprive their discoveries
of all character of authenticity. There is, in fact, a certain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"> [Pg 46]</a></span>
class of persons engaged in a deceptive manufacture who have taken a
delight in misleading archæologists by fabricating apocryphal flint
and stone implements, in which they drive a rather lucrative trade.
They assert, without the least scruple, the high antiquity of their
productions, which they sell either to inexperienced amateurs, who are
pleased to put them in their collections duly labelled and ticketed, or&mdash;which
is a more serious matter&mdash;to workmen who are engaged in
making excavations in fossiliferous beds. These workmen hide the
fictitious specimens in the soil they are digging, using every requisite
precaution so as to have the opportunity of subsequently extracting
them and fingering a reward for them from some too trusting
naturalist. These imitations are, moreover, so cleverly made, that it
sometimes requires well-practised eyes to recognise them; but they
may be recognised with some degree of facility by the following
characteristics:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter topspace2"><a name="i_071.jpg" id="i_071.jpg"></a>
<img src="images/i_071.jpg"
alt="Crystallisation on wrought flints"  />
<div class="caption">Fig. 8.&mdash;<i>Dendrites</i> or Crystallisations
found on the surface of wrought Flints.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">The ancient flints present a glassy surface which singularly
contrasts with the dull appearance of the fresh cleavages. They are
also for the most part covered with a whitish coating or <i>patina</i>,
which is nothing but a thin layer of carbonate of lime darkened in
colour by the action of time. Lastly, many of these flints are ornamented
with branching crystallisations, called <i>dendrites</i>, which form
on their surface very delicate designs of a dark brown; these are owing
to the combined action of the oxides of iron and manganese (fig. 8).</p>

<p>We must add that these flint implements often assume the colour
of the soil in which they have been buried for so many centuries; and
as Mr. Prestwich, a learned English geologist, well remarks, this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"> [Pg 47]</a></span>
agreement in colour indicates that they have remained a very considerable
time in the stratum which contains them.</p>

<p>Among the stone implements of primitive ages, some are found in a
state of perfect preservation, which clearly bears witness to their
almost unused state; others, on the contrary, are worn, rounded, and
blunted, sometimes because they have done good service in bygone
days, and sometimes because they have been many times rolled over
and rubbed by diluvial waters, the action of which has produced this
result. Some, too, are met with which are broken, and nothing of
them remains but mere vestiges. In a general way, they are completely
covered with a very thick coating which it is necessary to
break off before they can be laid open to view.</p>

<p>They are especially found under the soil in grottos and caves, on
which we shall remark further in some detail, and they are almost
always mixed up with the bones of extinct mammalian species.</p>

<p>Certain districts which are entirely devoid of caves contain, however,
considerable deposits of these stone implements. We may mention
in this category the alluvial quarternary beds of the valley of the
Somme, known under the name of drift beds, which were worked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"> [Pg 48]</a></span>
by Boucher de Perthes with an equal amount of perseverance and
success.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 9.&mdash;Section of a Gravel Quarry
at Saint-Acheul, which contained the wrought Flints found by
Boucher de Perthes.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">This alluvium was composed of a gravelly deposit, which geologists
refer to the great inundations which, during the epoch of the great
bear and the mammoth, gave to Europe, by hollowing out its valleys,
its present vertical outline. The excavations in the sand and gravel
near Amiens and Abbeville, which were directed with so much intelligence
by Boucher de Perthes, have been the means of exhuming
thousands of worked flints, affording unquestionable testimony of the
existence of man during the quaternary epoch.</p>

<p>All these worked flints may be classed under some of the
principal types, from which their intended use may be approximately
conjectured.</p>

<p>One of the types which is most extensively distributed, especially in
the drift beds of the valley of the Somme, where scarcely any other
kind is found, is the <i>almond-shaped</i> type (fig. 10).</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 10.&mdash;Hatchet of the <i>Almond-shaped</i> type,

</div>

<p class="topspace2">The instruments of this kind are hatchets of an oval shape, more
or less elongated, generally flattened on both sides, but sometimes
only on one, carefully chipped all over their surface so as to present a
cutting edge. The workmen of the Somme give them the graphic
name of <i>cats' tongues</i>.</p>

<p>They vary much in size, but are generally about six inches long by
three wide, although some are met with which are much larger. The
Pre-historic Gallery in the Universal Exposition of 1867, contained
one found at Saint-Acheul, and exhibited by M. Robert, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"> [Pg 49]</a></span>
measured eleven inches in length by five in width. This remarkable
specimen is represented in fig. 11.</p>

<p class="topspace2">Another very characteristic form is that which is called the <i>Moustier
type</i> (fig. 12), because they have been found in abundance in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"> [Pg 50]</a></span>
the beds in the locality of Moustier, which forms a portion of the
department of Dordogne. This name is applied to the pointed flints
which are only wrought on one side, the other face being completely
plain.</p>

<p class="topspace2">To the same deposit also belongs the flint <i>scraper</i>, the sharp edge of
which forms the arc of a circle, the opposite side being of some
considerable thickness so as to afford a grasp to the hand of the
operator.</p>

our saws.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 14.&mdash;Flint Knife, found at Menchecourt, near Abbeville.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2" >The third type (fig. 14) is that of <i>knives</i>. They are thin and
narrow tongue-shaped flakes, cleft off from the lump of flint at one
blow. When one of the ends is chipped to a point, these knives
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"> [Pg 51]</a></span>
become scratchers. Sometimes these flints are found to be wrought so
as to do service as augers.</p>

<p>The question is often asked, how these primitive men were able to
manufacture their weapons, implements, and utensils, on uniform
models, without the help of metallic hammers. This idea has, indeed,
been brought forward as an argument against those who contend for
the existence of quaternary man. Mr. Evans, an English geologist,
replied most successfully to this objection by a very simple experiment.
He took a pebble and fixed it in a wooden handle; having thus
manufactured a stone hammer, he made use of it to chip a flint little
by little, until he had succeeded in producing an oval hatchet similar
to the ancient one which he had before him.</p>

<p>The flint-workers who, up to the middle of the present century,
prepared gun-flints for the army, were in the habit of splitting the
stone into splinters. But they made use of steel hammers to cleave the
flint, whilst primitive man had nothing better at his disposal than
another and rather harder stone.</p>

<p>Primitive man must have gone to work in somewhat the following
way: They first selected flints, which they brought to the shape
of those cores or <i>nuclei</i> which are found in many places in company
with finished implements; then, by means of another and harder
stone of elongated shape, they cleft flakes off the flint. These flakes

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"> [Pg 52]</a></span>
hatchets, tomahawks, scrapers, &amp;c. Some amount of skill must have
been required to obtain the particular shape that was required; but
constant practice in this work exclusively must have rendered this
task comparatively easy.</p>

<p class="topspace2">How, in the next place, were these clipped flints fitted with
handles, so as to make hatchets, poniards and knives?</p>

<p>Some of them were fixed at right angles between the two split ends
of a stick: this kind of weapon must have somewhat resembled our
present hatchets. Others, of an oval shape and circular edge, might
have been fastened transversely into a handle, so as to imitate a carpenter's
adze. In case of need, merely a forked branch or a piece of
split wood might serve as sheath or handle to the flint blade. Flints
might also have been fixed as double-edged blades by means of holes
cut in pieces of wood, to which a handle was afterwards added.</p>

<p>These flint flakes might, lastly, be fitted into a handle at one
end. The wide-backed knives, which were only sharp on one side,
afforded a grasp for the hand without further trouble, and might
dispense with a handle. The small flints might also be darted as
projectiles by the help of a branch of a tree forming a kind of spring,
such as we may see used as a toy by children.</p>

<p>The mere description of these stone hatchets, fitted on to pieces
of wood, recall to our mind the natural weapons used by some
of the American savages, and the tribes which still exist in a state
of freedom in the Isles of Oceania. We allude to the tomahawk, a
name which we so often meet with in the accounts of voyages round
the world. Among those savage nations who have not as yet bent
their necks beneath the yoke of civilisation, we might expect to find&mdash;and,
in fact, we do find&mdash;the weapons and utensils which were peculiar
to man in primitive ages. A knowledge of the manners and customs
of the present Australian aborigines has much conduced to the success
of the endeavours to reconstruct a similar system of manners and
customs in respect to man of the quaternary age.</p>

<p>It was with the weapons and implements that we have just described
that man, at the epoch of the great bear and mammoth, was able to
repulse the attacks of the ferocious animals which prowled round his
retreat and often assailed him (fig. 16).</p>

</div>

<p class="topspace2">But the whole life of primitive man was not summed up in defending
himself against ferocious beasts, and in attacking them in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"> [Pg 53]</a></span>
chase. Beyond the needs which were imposed upon him by conflict
and hunting, he felt, besides, the constant necessity of quenching his
thirst. Water is a thing in constant use by man, whether he be
civilised or savage. The fluid nature of water renders it difficult to
convey it except by enclosing it in bladders, leathern bottles, hollowed-out
stumps of trees, plaited bowls, &amp;c. Receptacles of this kind were
certain ultimately to become dirty and unfit for the preservation of
water; added to this they could not endure the action of fire. It was
certainly possible to hollow out stone, so as to serve as a receptacle for
water; but any kind of stone which was soft enough to be scooped
out, and would retain its tenacity after this operation, is very rarely
met with. Shells, too, might be used to hold a liquid; but then shells
are not to be found in every place. It was, therefore, necessary to
resolve the problem&mdash;how far it might be possible to make vessels
which would be strong, capable of holding water, and able to stand
the heat of the fire without breaking or warping. What was required
was, in fact, the manufacture of pottery.</p>

<p>The potter's art may, perhaps, be traced back to the most remote
epochs of man. We have already seen, in the introduction to this
work, that, in 1835, M. Joly found in the cave of Nabrigas (Lozère),
a skull of the great bear pierced with a stone arrow-head, and that
by the side of this skull were also discovered fragments of pottery,
on which might still be seen the imprint of the fingers which moulded
it. Thus, the potter's art may have already been exercised in the
earliest period which we can assign to the development of mankind.</p>

<p>Other causes also might lead us to believe that man, at a very early
period of his existence, succeeded in the manufacture of rough pottery.</p>

<p>The clay which is used in making all kinds of pottery, from the
very lowest kitchen utensil up to the most precious specimens of porcelain,
may be said to exist almost everywhere. By softening it and
kneading it with water, it may be moulded into vessels of all shapes.
By mere exposure to the heat of the sun, these vessels will assume a
certain amount of cohesion; for, as tradition tells us, the towers and
palaces of ancient Nineveh were built entirely with bricks which had
been baked in the sun.</p>

<p>Yet the idea of hardening any clayey paste by means of the action
of fire is so very simple, that we are not of opinion that pottery which
had merely been baked in the sun was ever made use of to any great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"> [Pg 54]</a></span>
extent, even among primitive man. Mere chance, or the most casual
observation, might have taught our earliest forefathers that a morsel of
clay placed near a fire-hearth became hardened and altogether impenetrable
to water, that is, that it formed a perfect specimen of pottery.
Yet the art, though ancient, has not been universally found among
mankind.</p>

<p>Ere long, experience must have taught men certain improvements
in the manufacture of pottery. Sand was added to the clay, so as to
render it less subject to "flying" on its first meeting the heat of the
fire; next, dried straw was mixed with the clay in order to give it
more coherence.</p>

<p>In this way those rough vessels were produced, which were, of
course, moulded with the hand, and still bear the imprints of the
workman's fingers. They were only half-baked, on account of the
slight intensity of heat in the furnace which they were then obliged
to make use of, which was nothing more than a wood fire, burning in
the open air, on a stone hearth.</p>

<p>From these data we give a representation (fig. 17) of the <i>workshop
of the earliest potter</i>.</p>

<p class="topspace2">In the gravel pits in the neighbourhood of Amiens we meet with
small globular bodies with a hole through the middle, which are,
indeed, nothing but fossil shells found in the white chalk (fig. 18).
It is probable that these stony beads were used to adorn the men contemporary
with the diluvial period. The natural holes which existed
in them enabled them to be threaded as bracelets or necklaces. This,
at least, was the opinion of Dr. Rigollot; and it was founded on the
fact that he had often found small heaps of these delicate little balls
collected together in the same spot, as if an inundation had drifted
them into the bed of the river without breaking the bond which held
them together.</p>

<p class="topspace2">The necklaces, which men and women had already begun to wear
during the epoch of the great bear and the mammoth, were the first
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"> [Pg 55]</a></span>
outbreak of the sentiment of adornment, a feeling so natural to the
human species. The way in which these necklaces were put together
is, however, exactly similar to that which we meet with during the
present day among savage tribes&mdash;a thread on which a few shells
were strung, which was passed round the neck.</p>

<p>It has been supposed, from another series of wrought flints, found
at Saint-Acheul by Boucher de Perthes, that the men of the epoch of
the great bear and mammoth may have executed certain rough sketches
of art-workmanship, representing either figures or symbols. Boucher
de Perthes has, in fact, found flints which he considered to show
representations, with varying degrees of resemblance, of the human
head, in profile, three-quarter view, and full face; also of animals,
such as the rhinoceros and the mammoth.</p>

<p>There are many other flints, evidently wrought by the hand of man,
which were found by Boucher de Perthes in the same quaternary
deposits; but it would be a difficult matter to decide their intention
or significance. Some, perhaps, were religious symbols, emblems of
authority, &amp;c. The features which enable us to recognise the work
of man in these works of antediluvian art, are the symmetry of shape
and the repetition of successive strokes by which the projecting
portions are removed, the cutting edges sharpened, or the holes
bored out.</p>

<p>The natural colour of all the wrought flints we have just been considering,
which bring under our notice the weapons and utensils of
man in the earliest epoch of his existence, is a grey which assumes
every tint, from the brightest to the darkest; but, generally speaking,
they are stained and coloured according to the nature of the soil from
which they are dug out. Argillaceous soils colour them white; ochreous
gravels give them a yellowish brown hue. Some are white on one
side and brown on the other, probably from having lain between two
different beds.</p>

<p>This <i>patina</i> (to use the established term) is the proof of their long-continued
repose in the beds, and is, so to speak, the stamp of their
antiquity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> given a description of the weapons and working implements
of the men belonging to the great bear and mammoth epoch, we must
now proceed to speak of the habitations.</p>

<p>Caverns hollowed out in the depth of the rocks formed the first
dwellings of man. We must, therefore, devote some degree of attention
to the simple and wild retreats of our forefathers. As the objects
which have been found in these caverns are both numerous and varied
in their character, they not only throw a vivid light on the manners
and customs of primitive man, but also decisively prove the fact of his
being contemporary with mammals of species now extinct, such as the
mammoth, the great bear, and the <i>Rhinoceros tichorhinus</i>.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"> [Pg 57]</a></span></p>
<p>But before proceeding any further, it is necessary to inquire in
what way these caverns could have been formed, in which we find
accumulated so many relics of the existence of primitive man.</p>

<p>M. Desnoyers, Librarian of the Museum of Natural History at
Paris, is of opinion that these caverns are crevices of the same class as
metalliferous <i>lodes</i>, only instead of containing metallic ores they must
have been originally filled by the deposits of certain thermal springs.</p>

Carboniferous Limestone, <i>before</i> the hollowing out
of Valleys by diluvial Waters.
</div>

<p class="topspace2">Fig. 19 represents, according to M. Desnoyers' treatise on <i>caverns</i>,
one of these primordial veins in the carboniferous limestone. At the
time of the diluvial inundation, these veins were opened by the impetuous
action of the water. When thus cleared out and brought to
the light of day, they assumed the aspect of caves, as represented in
fig. 20.</p>

<div class="figcenter topspace2"><a name="i_086.jpg" id="i_086.jpg"></a>
<img src="images/i_086.jpg"

<div class="caption">Fig. 20.&mdash;Theoretical section of the same Vein of Clay converted into a Cavern, <i>after</i> the hollowing out
of Valleys by diluvial Waters.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">The European diluvial inundation was, as we know, posterior to the
glacial epoch.</p>

<p>It is also likely that caverns were sometimes produced by the
falling in of portions of some of the interior strata, or that they were
formerly the natural and subterranean channels of certain watercourses;
many instances of this kind being now known in different
countries.</p>

<p>We must also add that it is not probable that all caverns originated
in the same way; but that one or other of the several causes just
enumerated must have contributed to their formation.</p>

<p>Under the general denomination of <i>caverns</i>, all kinds of subterranean
cavities are comprehended; but it will be as well to introduce
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"> [Pg 58]</a></span>
several distinctions in this respect. There are, in the first place,
simple clefts or crevices, which are only narrow pits deviating but
slightly from the vertical. Next we have grottos (or <i>baumes</i> as
they are called in the south of France), which generally have a widely
opening inlet, and are but of small extent. Lastly, we must draw a
distinction between these and the real bone caverns, which consist of
a series of chambers, separated by extremely narrow passages, and are
often of very considerable dimensions. Some of these caverns occupy
an extent of several leagues underground, with variations of level
which render their exploration very difficult. They are generally
very inaccessible, and it is almost always necessary to ply the pick-axe
in order to clear a way from one chamber to another.</p>

<p>In most of these grottos and caverns the ground and sides are
covered with calcareous deposits, known by the name of <i>stalactite</i>
and <i>stalagmite</i>, which sometimes meet one another, forming columns
and pillars which confer on some of these subterranean halls an elegance
replete with a kind of mysterious charm.</p>

<p>These deposits are caused by the infiltrated water charged with
carbonate of lime, which, oozing drop by drop through the interstices of
the rock, slowly discharge the carbonic acid which held the carbonate
of lime in solution, and the salts gradually precipitating form the crystalline
or amorphous deposits which constitute these natural columns.</p>

<p>The calcareous deposits which spread over the ground of the
caverns are called <i>stalagmite</i>, and the name of <i>stalactite</i> is given to
those which hang down from the roof, forming pendants, natural
decorations, and ornaments as of alabaster or marble, producing sometimes
the most magnificent effects.</p>

<p>Under the stalagmite the largest number of animal bones have
been found. This crust, which has been to them a preservatory
grave, is so thick and hard that a pick-axe is required in order to break
it. Thanks to the protecting cover, the bones have been sheltered
from all the various causes of decomposition and destruction. The
limestone formed a kind of cement which, uniting clay, mud, sand,
flints, bones of men and animals, weapons and utensils into a compact
mass, has preserved them for the study and consideration of scientific
men in our own days.</p>

<p>The soil called <i>bone-earth</i> is, in fact, found under the crystalline
bed which covers the ground of the caverns.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"> [Pg 59]</a></span></p>
<p>Fig. 21, which represents a section of the cave of Galeinreuth, in
Bavaria, will enable us clearly to understand the position occupied by
the bones in most of these caverns.</p>

<div class="figcenter topspace2"><a name="i_088.jpg" id="i_088.jpg"></a>
<img src="images/i_088.jpg"
alt="Cave of Galeinreuth"  />
<div class="caption">Fig. 21.&mdash;The Cave of Galeinreuth, in Bavaria.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">Bone-earth consists of a reddish or yellowish clay, often mixed with
pebbles, which seem to have come from some distant beds, for they
cannot be attributed to the adjacent rocks. This stratum varies considerably
in depth; in some spots it is very thin, in others it rises
almost to the top of the cavern, to a height of forty or fifty feet.
But in this case it is, in reality, composed of several strata belonging
to different ages, and explorers ought to note with much attention the
exact depth of any of the organic remains found in their mass.</p>

<p>There are, however, in several bone-caverns certain peculiarities
which demand a special explanation. Caves often contain large heaps
of bones, situated at heights which it would have been absolutely inaccessible
to the animals which lived in these places. How, then, was
it possible that these bones could have found their way to such an
elevated position? It is also a very strange fact, that no cavern has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"> [Pg 60]</a></span>
ever produced an entire skeleton or even a whole limb of the skeleton
of a man, and scarcely of any animal whatever. The bones, in fact,
not only lie in confusion and utter disorder, but, up to the present time,
it has been impossible to find all the bones which in times past formed
an individual. It must, therefore, be admitted, that the accumulation
of bones and human remains in most of the caves are owing to other
causes than the residence of man and wild animals in these dark
retreats.</p>

<p>It is supposed, therefore, that the bones in question were deposited
in these hollows by the rushing in of the currents of diluvial water,
which had drifted them along in their course. A fact which renders
this hypothesis likely is that drift-pebbles are constantly found in
close proximity to these bones. Now these pebbles come from localities
at considerable distances from the cavern; often, indeed, terrestrial
and fluviatile shells accompany these bones. It may sometimes be
remarked that the femurs and tibias of large mammals have their
points rubbed off, and the smallest bones are reduced to rounded
fragments. These are all evident indications that these bones had
been carried along by rapid currents of water, which swept away everything
in their course; or, in other words, by the current of the waters
of the deluge which signalised the quaternary epoch.</p>

<p>During this period of the existence of primitive man, all these
caverns were not applied to the same purpose. Some were the dens
of wild beasts, others formed the habitations of man, and others again
were used as burial-places.</p>

<p>There is no difficulty in the idea that dens of wild beasts might
very readily be occupied by man, after he had killed or driven out the
fierce inhabitants; no discovery, however, has as yet confirmed this
supposition. It can hardly be doubted that primitive man seldom
dared to take up his abode in dens which had been, for some time, the
refuge of any of the formidable carnivora; if he did, it was only after
having assured himself that these retreats had been altogether
abandoned by their terrible inhabitants.</p>

<p>We shall now proceed to consider these three classes of caverns.</p>

<p>Caves which, during the quaternary epoch, have served as dens for
wild animals, are very numerous. Experienced <i>savants</i> are enabled to
recognise them by various indications. The bones they contain are
never fractured; but it may be seen that they have been gnawed by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"> [Pg 61]</a></span>
carnivorous animals, as they still bear the marks of their teeth. Into
these retreats the cave-lion (<i>Felis spelæa</i>) and the hyæna (<i>Hyæna
spelæa</i>) were accustomed to drag their prey, in order there to tear it
to pieces and devour it, or divide it into portions for their young ones.
In fact, in these caverns, excrements of the hyæna mixed with small
and undigested bones are often found. The cave bear retired into
the same retreats, but he probably only came there to pass the period
of his hibernal sleep. Lastly, the same dens no doubt offered a refuge
to sick or dying animals, who resorted thither in order to expire in
peace. We have a proof of this in the traces of wounds and caries on
some of the bones of animals found by Schmerling in the caverns of
the Meuse; also in the skull of a hyæna, the median ridge of which
had been bitten and appeared to be half healed.</p>

<p>Those caverns which formed a shelter for primitive man are, like
the preceding ones, to be recognised by a mere inspection of the
bones contained in them. The long bones of the ox, horse, stag,
rhinoceros, and other quadrupeds which formed the food of man during
the quaternary epoch, are always split; and they are all broken in
the same way, that is, lengthwise. The only cause for their having
been split in this manner must have been the desire of extracting the
marrow for the purpose of eating. Such a mode of breaking them
would never have been practised by any animal.</p>

<p>This apparently trivial circumstance is, however, of the highest
importance. In fact, it leads to the following conclusion: "That man,
having eaten large mammals of species now extinct, must have been
contemporary with these species."</p>

<p>We shall now proceed to examine the caverns which were used as
burial-places for man.</p>

<p>To M. Édouard Lartet, the celebrated palæontologist, the honour
must be ascribed of having been the first to collect any important
data bearing on the fact that caverns were used for burial-places by
the primitive man of the great bear and mammoth epoch. We have
thus been led to discover the traces of a funeral custom belonging to
the man of these remote ages; we allude to the <i>funeral banquet</i>.
The source of this information was the discovery of a pre-historic
burial-place at Aurignac (Haute-Garonne), of which we have given an
account in the Introduction to this work, which, however, we must
again here refer to.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"> [Pg 62]</a></span></p>
<p>Near the town of Aurignac rises the hill of Fajoles, which the
inhabitants of the country, in their <i>patois</i>, call "<i>mountagno de las
Hajoles</i>" (beech-tree mountain), a circumstance showing that it was
formerly covered with beech-trees. As we have already stated, in the
Introduction to this work, it was on one of the slopes of this hill that,
in the year 1842, an excavator, named Bonnemaison, discovered a
great slab of limestone placed in a vertical position and closing up an
arched opening. In the cave closed up by this slab the excavator
discovered the remains of seventeen human skeletons!</p>

<p>We have already told how these skeletons were removed to the
village cemetery, and thus, unfortunately, for ever lost to the researches
of science.</p>

<p>Eighteen years after, in 1860, M. Lartet, having heard of the event,
repaired to the spot, accompanied by Bonnemaison; he quite understood
how it had happened that, during a long course of centuries, the cave
had escaped the notice of the inhabitants of the country. The entrance
to it was concealed by masses of earth which, having been brought
down from the top of the hill by the action of the water, had accumulated
in front of the entrance, hiding a flat terrace, on which many
vestiges of pre-historic times were found. As no disturbance of the
ground had taken place in this spot subsequent to the date of the
burial, this <i>talus</i> had been sufficient to protect the traces of the men
who were contemporary with the mammoth, and to shield their relics
from all exterior injury.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"> [Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<p>After a rapid inspection of the cave and its surroundings, M. Lartet
resolved to make complete and methodical excavations, aided by intelligent
workmen labouring under his superintendence; the following
are the results he obtained.</p>

<p>A bed of "made ground" two feet thick covered the ground of the
cave. In this were found some human remains which had escaped
the first investigations; also bones of mammals in good preservation,
and exhibiting no fractures or teeth-marks, wrought flints, mostly of the
<i>knife</i> type (fig. 23), and carved reindeer horns, among which there was
an instrument carefully tapered off and rounded, but deprived of its point
(fig. 24), the other end being bevelled off, probably to receive a handle.</p>

</div>

<p class="topspace2">We must here add, that at the time of his discovery Bonnemaison
collected, from the midst of the bones, eighteen small discs which
were pierced in the centre, and doubtless intended to be strung
together in a necklace or bracelet. These discs, which were formed
of a white compact substance were recognised as sea-shells of a
<i>Cardium</i> species.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">The cavern of Aurignac was a burial-place of the quaternary
epoch, for M. Lartet found in it a quantity of the bones of the cave-bear,
the bison, the reindeer, the horse, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In fig. 26, we give a representation of a fragment of the lower jaw
of a great bear as an example of the state of the bones found in this
cavern.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">The perfect state of preservation of these bones shows that they
were neither broken to furnish food for man nor torn by carnivorous
animals, particularly by hyænas, as is seen in a great many caverns.
We must therefore conclude from this peculiarity, that the stone
which closed the entrance to the cave was moved away for
every interment and carefully put back into its place immediately
afterwards.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"> [Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<p>In order to explain the presence of so many foreign objects by the
side of the human skeletons&mdash;such as animals' bones&mdash;implements of
flint and reindeers' horn&mdash;necklaces or bracelets&mdash;we must admit as
probable that a funeral custom existed among the men of the great bear
and mammoth epoch, which has been preserved in subsequent ages.
They used to place in the tomb, close to the body, the weapons, hunting
trophies, and ornaments of all sorts, belonging to the defunct. This
custom still exists among many tribes in a more or less savage state.</p>

<p>In front of the cave, there was, as we have already said, a kind of
flat spot which had afterwards become covered with earth which had
fallen down from the top of the hill. When the earth which covered
this flat spot was cleared away, they met with another deposit containing
bones. This deposit was situated on a prolongation of the
ground on which the skeletons were placed in the interior of the
cavern. Under this deposit, was a bed of ashes and charcoal, 5 to
7 inches thick. This was, therefore, the site of an ancient fire-hearth.</p>

<p>In other words, in front of the sepulchral cave there was a kind of
terrace upon which, after the interment of the body in the cavern, a
feast called the <i>funeral banquet</i> was held.</p>

</div>

<p class="topspace2">In this bed, situated in front of the cavern an immense number of
the most interesting relics were discovered&mdash;a large number of the
teeth and broken bones of herbivorous animals (fig. 27); a hundred
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"> [Pg 66]</a></span>
flint knives; two chipped flints, which archæologists believe
to be sling projectiles; a rounded pebble with a depression in
the middle, which, according to Mr. Steinhauer, keeper of the
Ethnographical Museum at Copenhagen, was used to flake off
flint-knives; lastly, a large quantity of implements made of reindeers'
horn, which exhibit the most varied shapes. We may mention,
for instance, the arrow-heads fashioned very simply, without wings
or barbs (fig. 28); some of these heads appear to have been subjected
to the action of fire, as if they had been left in the body of
the animal during the process of cooking; a bodkin made of roebuck's
horn (fig. 29) very carefully pointed, and in such a good
state of preservation that it might still be used, says M. Lartet, to
perforate the skins of animals before sewing them; and this must, in
fact, have been its use; a second instrument, similar to the preceding,
but less finely pointed, which M. Lartet is inclined to consider
as an instrument for tatooing; some thin blades of various sizes,
which, according to Steinhauer, much resemble the reindeer-horn
polishers still used by the Laplanders to flatten down the seams of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"> [Pg 67]</a></span>
their coarse skin-garments; another blade, accidentally broken at
both ends, one of the sides of which is perfectly polished and shows
two series of transversal lines at equal distances apart; the lateral
edges of this blade are marked with deeper notches at almost regular
intervals (fig. 30). M. Lartet considers that these lines and
notches are signs of numeration, and Mr. Steinhauer has propounded
the idea that they are hunting-marks. Both hypotheses are possible,
and the more so as they do not contradict each other.</p>

</div>

<p class="topspace2">Among the bones, some were partly carbonised, others, only
scorched, but the greater number had not been subjected at all to the
action of fire. All the bones having medullary hollows, and commonly
called marrow-bones, were broken lengthwise, a certain indication
that this operation had been effected to extract the marrow, and
that these bones had been used at a feast carried on according to the
manners and customs of that epoch, when the marrow out of animal
bones was regarded as the most delicious viand&mdash;many men of our
own days being also of this opinion.</p>

<p>A certain number of these bones exhibited shallow cuts, showing
that a sharp instrument had been used to detach the flesh from them.
Nearly all those which had not been subjected to the action of fire
bore the mark of the teeth of some carnivorous animal. This animal,
doubtless, came to gnaw them after man had taken his departure from
the spot. This carnivorous animal could have been none other than
the hyæna, as is shown by the excrements left in the place.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"> [Pg 68]</a></span></p>
<p>The ossiferous mound situated immediately above the fire-hearth
contained, like the subjacent ashes, a large number of the bones of
certain herbivorous animals.</p>

<p>The discovery of the fire-hearth situated in front of the cave of
Aurignac, and the various remains which were found intermingled
underneath it, enable us to form some idea of the way in which funeral
ceremonies took place among the men of the great bear epoch. The
parents and friends of the defunct accompanied him to his last resting-place;
after which, they assembled together to partake of a feast in
front of the tomb soon to be closed on his remains. Then everyone
took his departure, leaving the scene of their banquet free to the
hyænas, which came to devour the remains of the meal.</p>

<p>This custom of funeral-feasts is, doubtless, very natural, as it has
been handed down to our days; though it now chiefly exists among
the poorer classes.</p>

<p>In accordance with the preceding data we here represent (fig. 31)
a <i>funeral feast during the great bear and mammoth epoch</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord topspace2"><a name="i_098.jpg" id="i_098.jpg"></a>
<img src="images/i_098.jpg"
alt="Feast"  />
<div class="caption">Fig. 31.&mdash;Funeral Feast during the Great Bear
and Mammoth Epoch.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">On a flat space situated in front of the cave destined to receive the
body of the defunct, some men covered merely with bears' skins with
the hair on them are seated round a fire, taking their part in the
funeral-feast. The flesh of the great bear and mammoth forms the
<i>menu</i> of these primitive love-feasts. In the distance may be seen the
colossal form of the mammoth, which forms the chief dish of the
banquet. The manner of eating is that which distinguishes the men
of that epoch; they suck the marrow from the long bones which have
previously been split lengthwise, and eat the flesh of the animals
cooked on the hearth. The dead body is left at the entrance of the
cavern; the primitive grave-stone will soon close on it for ever.</p>

<p>The relics found in the interior of the sepulchral cave of Aurignac
have led to a very remarkable inference, which shows how interesting
and fertile are the studies which have been made by naturalists on the
subject of the antiquity of man. The weapons, the trophies, the ornaments,
and the joints of meat, placed by the side of the defunct&mdash;does
not all this seem to establish the fact that a belief in a future life
existed at an extraordinarily remote epoch? What could have been
the use of these provisions for travelling, and these instruments of
war, if the man who had disappeared from this world was not to live
again in another? The great and supreme truth&mdash;that the whole
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"> [Pg 69]</a></span>
being of man does not die with his material body is, therefore, innate
in the human heart; since it is met with in the most remote ages,
and even existed in the mental consciousness of the man of the stone
age.</p>

<p>An instinct of art also appears to have manifested itself in the
human race at this extremely ancient date. Thus, one of the articles
picked up in the sepulchral cave of Aurignac consisted of a canine
tooth of a young cave-bear, perforated so as to allow of its being
suspended in some way or other. Now this tooth is so carved that no
one can help recognising in it a rough outline of some animal shape,
the precise nature of which is difficult to determine, although it may,
perhaps, be the head of a bird. It was, doubtless, an amulet or jewel
belonging to one of the men interred in the cave, and was buried
with him because he probably attached a great value to it. This
object, therefore, shows us that some instincts of art existed in the
men who hunted the great bear and mammoth.</p>

</div>

<p class="topspace2">We shall close this account of the valuable discoveries which were
made in the sepulchral cave of Aurignac, by giving a list of the species
of mammals the bones of which were found either in the interior or
at the exterior of this cavern. The first six species are extinct; the
others are still living:&mdash;</p>

<p>The great cave-bear (<i>Ursus spelæus</i>); the mammoth (<i>Elephas
primigenius</i>); the rhinoceros (<i>Rhinoceros tichorhinus</i>); the great
cave-lion (<i>Felis spelæa</i>); the cave-hyæna (<i>Hyæna spelæa</i>); the
gigantic stag (<i>Megaceros hibernicus</i>); the bison, the reindeer, the stag,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"> [Pg 70]</a></span>
the horse, the ass, the roe, the wild boar, the fox, the wolf, the wild-cat,
the badger, and the polecat.</p>

<p>We think it as well to place before the eyes of our readers the
exact forms of the heads of the three great fossil animals found in the
cave of Aurignac, which geologically characterise the great bear and
mammoth epoch, and evidently prove that man was contemporary
with these extinct species. Figs. 33, 34, and 35 represent the heads
of the cave-bear, the <i>Rhinoceros tichorhinus</i>, and the <i>megaceros</i> or
gigantic stag; they are taken from the casts which adorn the great
hall of the Archæological and Pre-historic Museum at Saint-Germain,
and are among the most curious ornaments of this remarkable museum.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">Of all these species, the fox has left behind him the largest number
of remains. This carnivorous animal was represented by about
eighteen to twenty individual specimens. Neither the mammoth,
great cave-lion, nor wild boar appear to have been conveyed into the
cave in an entire state; for two or three molar or incisive teeth are
the only remains of their carcases which have been found.</p>

<p>But still it is a certain fact that the men who fed on the <i>Rhinoceros</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"> [Pg 71]</a></span>
<i>tichorinus</i> buried their dead in this cavern. In fact, M. Lartet asserts
that the bones of the rhinoceros had been split by man in order to
extract the marrow. They had also been gnawed by hyænas, which
would not have been the case if these bones had not been thrown
away, and left on the ground in a fresh state.</p>

<p>The burial-place of Aurignac dates back to the earliest antiquity,
that is to say, it was anterior to the European diluvial period. Thus,
according to M. Lartet, the great cave-bear was the first of the
extinct species to disappear; then the mammoth and <i>Rhinoceros
tichorhinus</i> were lost sight of; still later, the reindeer first, and
then the bison, migrated to the northern and eastern regions of
Europe. Now, the <i>diluvium</i>, that is to say, the beds formed by
drifted pebbles and originating in the great derangement caused by
the inundation of the quaternary epoch, does not contain any traces
of the bones of the cave-bear. It, therefore, belongs to an epoch
of the stone age more recent than the cave of Aurignac.
<a name="fnanchor_6" id="fnanchor_6"></a><a href="#footnote_6"
class="fnanchor">[6]</a> All this
goes to prove that this sepulchral cave, which has furnished the
science of the antiquity of man with so much valuable information,
belonged to the great bear and mammoth epoch, which preceded the
diluvial cataclysm.</p>

Race during the Epochs of the Great Bear and the Reindeer&mdash;The Skulls from
the Caves of Engis and Neanderthal.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">With</span> regard to the bone-caves, which have furnished us with such
valuable information as to the men who lived in the epoch of the
great bear and the mammoth, we have laid down a necessary distinction,
dividing them into caves which served as dens for wild
beasts, those which have afforded a refuge for man, and those which
were used as his burial-places. In order to complete this subject
and set forth the whole of the discoveries which have been made by
science on this interesting point, we will say a few words as to the
principal bone-caves belonging to the same epoch which have been
studied in France, England and Belgium.</p>

<p>We will, in the first place, call attention to the fact that these
caverns, taken together, embrace a very long period of time, perhaps an
enormous number of centuries, and that hence a considerable difference
must result in the nature of the remains of human industry which
they contain. Some certainly manifest a perceptible superiority over
others in an industrial point of view; but the reason is that they
belong to a period somewhat nearer our own, although still forming a
part of the epoch of the great bear and mammoth.</p>

<p>We shall divide the caves in France into three groups&mdash;those of
the east, those of the west and centre, and those of the south.</p>

<p>In the first group, we shall mention the <i>Trou de la Fontaine</i> and
the <i>Cave of Sainte-Reine</i>, both situated in the environs of Toul
(Meurthe). These two caves have furnished bones of bears, hyænas,
and the rhinoceros, along with the products of human industry.
That of Sainte-Reine has been explored by M. Guérin, and especially
by M. Husson, who has searched it with much care.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"> [Pg 73]</a></span></p>
<p>The second group includes the grottos <i>des Fées</i>, of Vergisson,
Vallières, and La Chaise.</p>

<p>The Grotte des Fées, at Arcy (Yonne), has been searched and
described by M. de Vibraye, who ascertained the existence of two
distinct beds, the upper one belonging to the reindeer epoch, the
lower one to the great bear epoch. These two beds were divided from
each other by matter which had formed a part of the roof of the
cave, and had fallen down on the earlier deposit. In the more
ancient bed of the two, M. de Vibraye collected fractured bones of
the bear and cave-hyæna, the mammoth, and the <i>Rhinoceros tichorhinus</i>,
all intermingled with flints wrought by the hand of man,
amongst which were chips of hyaline quartz (rock-crystal.) His
fellow-labourer, M. Franchet, extracted from it a human <i>atlas</i> (the
upper part of the vertebral column).</p>

<p>The cave of Vergisson (Saône-et-Loire), explored by M. de Ferry,
furnished the same kind of bones as the preceding cave, and also
bones of the bison, the reindeer, the horse, the wolf, and the fox, all
intermixed with wrought flints and fragments of rough pottery.
The presence of this pottery indicated that the cave of Vergisson
belonged to the latter period of the great bear epoch.</p>

<p>The cave of Vallières (Loir-et-Cher), was worked, first by M. de
Vibraye, and subsequently by the Abbé Bourgeois. There was
nothing particular to be remarked.</p>

<p>The cave of La Chaise, near Vouthon (Charente), explored by
MM. Bourgeois and Delaunay, furnished bones of the cave-bear, the
rhinoceros, and the reindeer, flint blades and scrapers, a bodkin and
a kind of hook made of bone, an arrow-head in the shape of a willow-leaf
likewise of bone, a bone perforated so as to hang on a string, and,
what is more remarkable, two long rods of reindeer's horn, tapering
at one end and bevelled off at the other, on which figures of animals
were graven. These relics betray an artistic feeling of a decided
character as existing in the men, the traces of whom are found in this
cave.</p>

<p>Among the caves in the south of France, we must specify those of
Périgord, those of Bas-Languedoc, and of the district of Foix (department
of Ariége).</p>

<p>The caves of Périgord have all been explored by MM. Lartet and
Christy, who have also given learned descriptions of them. We will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"> [Pg 74]</a></span>
mention the caves of the <i>Gorge d'Enfer</i> and <i>Moustier</i>, in the valley
of the Vézère, and that of <i>Pey de l'Azé</i>, all three situate in the department
of Dordogne (arrondissement of Sarlat).</p>

<p>The two caves of the <i>Gorge d'Enfer</i> were, unfortunately, cleared
out in 1793, in order to utilise the deposits of saltpetre which they
contained in the manufacture of gunpowder. They have, however,
furnished flints chipped into the shapes of scrapers, daggers, &amp;c., a
small pebble of white quartz, hollowed out on one side, which had
probably been used as a mortar, and instruments of bone or reindeer's
horn, three of which showed numerous notches. Bones of the great
bear clearly indicated the age of these settlements.</p>

<p>The cave of Moustier, situated about 80 feet above the Vézère,
is celebrated for the great number and characteristic shapes of its
stone implements, which we have before spoken of. Hatchets of
the almond-shaped type, like those of the <i>diluvium</i> of Abbeville and
Saint-Acheul, were very plentiful. Bi-convex spear-heads were also
found, of very careful workmanship, and instruments which might be
held in the hand, some of them of considerable dimensions; but no
pieces of bone or of reindeer's horn were discovered which had been
adapted to any purpose whatever. The bones were those of the great
bear and cave-hyæna, accompanied by separate <i>laminæ</i> of molars of
the mammoth, the use of which it is impossible to explain. Similar
fragments were met with in some of the other Périgord settlements,
and M. Lartet also found some at Aurignac.</p>

<p>Next to the cave of Pey de l'Azé, on which we shall not dwell, come
the caverns of Bas-Languedoc, which we shall only enumerate. They
consist of the caves of Pondres and Souvignargues (Hérault), which
were studied in 1829 by M. de Christol, who recognised, from the
data he derived from them, the co-existence of man and the great
extinct mammals; also those of Pontil and La Roque, the first explored
by M. Paul Gervais, the second by M. Boutin.</p>

<p>We shall now consider the caves of the department of Ariége, some
of which furnish objects of very considerable interest. They consist
of the caves of <i>Massat</i>, <i>Lherm</i>, and <i>Bouicheta</i>.</p>

<p>Two caves, very remarkable on account of their extent, have been
explored by M. Fontan; they are situate in the valley of Massat,
which contains others of less importance. One is placed at the foot of
a limestone mountain, about 60 feet above the bottom of the valley;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"> [Pg 75]</a></span>
the opening of the other is much higher up; only the latter belongs
to the great bear epoch.</p>

<p>From the results of his explorations, M. Fontan is of opinion that
the ground in them has been greatly altered by some violent inundation
which has intermingled the remains of various geological epochs.
This <i>savant</i> found in the cave of Massat the bones of the bear, the
hyæna and the great cave-lion, the fox, the badger, the wild boar,
the roe, &amp;c., two human teeth, and a bone arrow-head. Two beds of
ashes and charcoal were also remarked at different depths.</p>

<p>In the upper cave of Massat was found the curious stone on which
is designed with tolerable correctness a sketch of the great cave-bear
(fig. 36). This singular record marks out for us the earliest
trace of the art of design, which we shall find developing itself in a
more decisive way during the pre-historic period which follows the
one we are now considering.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 36.&mdash;Sketch of the Great Bear on a
Stone found in the Cave of Massat.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">The caves of Lherm and Bouicheta were inspected by MM. Garrigou
and Filhol, who found in them bones of most of the great
mammals belonging to extinct species, and particularly those of the
great bear, many of which are broken, and still show the marks of the
instruments which were used for cutting the flesh off them. Some
have been gnawed by hyænas, as proved by the deep grooves with
which they are marked. Lower jaw-bones of the great bear, and
of the great cave-lion, have been found fashioned, according to a
uniform plan, in the shape of hoes. MM. Garrigou and Filhol were
of opinion that these jaw-bones, when thus modified, might have been
used as offensive weapons.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"> [Pg 76]</a></span></p>
<p>The cave of Lherm contained also human bones; namely, three
teeth, a fragment of a <i>scapula</i>, a broken <i>ulna</i> and <i>radius</i>, and the
last joint of the great toe; all these remains presented exactly the
same appearance and condition as those of the <i>Ursus spelæus</i>, and
must, therefore, have belonged to the same epoch.</p>

<p>We have stated that numerous caves have been explored in England,
Belgium, and several other countries. We shall not undertake
to give with regard to each details which would only be a reproduction
of those which precede. We therefore confine ourselves to
mentioning the most celebrated of the caverns belonging to the epoch
of the great bear and the mammoth.</p>

<p>In England we have the Kent's Hole and Brixham caverns, near
Torquay in Devonshire, the latter of which is many hundred yards in
extent; the caves of the Gower peninsula, in Glamorganshire (South
Wales), which have been carefully studied within the last few years by
Messrs. Falconer and Wood; in these were found flint instruments
along with bones of the <i>Elephas antiquus</i> and the <i>Rhinoceros hemitæchus</i>,
species which were still more ancient than the mammoth and
the <i>Rhinoceros tichorhinus</i>; those of Kirkdale, in Yorkshire, explored
by Dr. Buckland, the geologist; those near Wells in Somersetshire,
Wokey Hole, Minchin Hole, &amp;c.</p>

<p>We must mention, in the north of Italy, the caves of Chiampo and
Laglio, on the edge of the Lake of Como, in which, just as at Vergisson,
fragments of rough pottery have been discovered, indicating
some degree of progress in the manufacture; also the caves in the
neighbourhood of Palermo, and especially those of San Ciro and
Macagnone.</p>

<p>In the last-mentioned cave, in the midst of an osseous <i>breccia</i> which
rose to the roof, Dr. Falconer collected flint instruments, splinters of
bone, pieces of baked clay and wood charcoal mixed up with large
land-shells (<i>Helix vermiculata</i>), in a perfect state of preservation,
horses' teeth, and the excrements of the hyæna, all cemented together
in a deposit of carbonate of lime. In a lower bed were found the
bones of various species of the hippopotamus, the <i>Elephas antiquus</i>,
and other great mammals.</p>

<p>Lastly, Spain, Algeria, Egypt, and Syria also present to our notice
caves belonging to the Stone Age.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"> [Pg 77]</a></span></p>
<p>In the New World various bone-caverns have been explored. We
must especially mention Brazil, in which country Lund searched no
less than eight hundred caves of different epochs, exhuming in them
a great number of unknown animal species. In one of these caves,
situated near the Lake of Sumidouro, Lund found some human bones
which had formed a part of thirty individuals of different ages, and
were "in a similar state of decomposition, and in similar circumstances
to the bones of various extinct species of animals."</p>

<p>Thus far we have designedly omitted to mention the Belgian caves.
They have, in fact, furnished us with such remarkable relics of former
ages that, in dealing with them, we could not confine ourselves to a
mere notice. The caves in the neighbourhood of Liége, which were
explored in 1833 by Schmerling, deserve to be described in some detail.</p>

<p>Schmerling examined more than forty caves in the Valley of the
Meuse and its tributaries. The access to some of these caves was so
difficult that in order to reach them it was necessary for the explorer
to let himself down by a cord, and then to crawl flat on his face
through narrow galleries, so as to make his way into the great
chambers; there he was obliged to remain for hours, and sometimes
whole days, standing up to his knees in mud, with water dripping
from the walls upon his head, while overlooking the workmen breaking
up with their pick-axes the layer of stalagmite, so as to bring to
light the bone earth&mdash;the records on which are inscribed the palpable
evidences of the high antiquity of man. Schmerling was compelled
to accomplish a perilous expedition of this kind in his visit to the
cave of Engis, which has become celebrated by the two human skulls
found there by him.</p>

<p>Nearly all the caves in the province of Liége contain scattered
bones of the great bear, the cave-hyæna, the mammoth, and the
rhinoceros, intermixed with those of species which are still living,
such as the wolf, the wild boar, the roe, the beaver, the porcupine,
&amp;c. Several of them contained human bones, likewise much scattered
and rubbed; they were found in all positions, and at every elevation,
sometimes above and sometimes below the above-mentioned animal
remains; from this it may be concluded that these caves had been
filled with running water, which drifted in all kinds of <i>débris</i>. None
of them, however, contained any gnawed bones, or the fossil excrement
of any animal species, which puts an end to the hypothesis that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"> [Pg 78]</a></span>
these caves had been used as dens by wild beasts. Here and there
bones were found belonging to the same skeleton, which were in
perfect preservation, and lying in their natural juxtaposition; they
were probably drifted into the cave by gently flowing water, while
still covered with their flesh, and no movement of the ground had
since separated them. But no complete skeleton has as yet been discovered,
even among the smaller species of mammiferous animals, the
disjunction of which is generally less complete.</p>

<p>In almost all the caves Schmerling met with flint implements
chipped into the form of hatchets and knives, and he calls attention
to the fact "that none of them could have been introduced into
the caves at a posterior epoch, as they were found in the same position
as the animal remains which accompanied them." In the cave
of Clokier, about two and a half miles from Liége, he picked up a
polished bone in the shape of a needle, having an eye pierced at the
base; in the cave of Engis he likewise found a carved bone, and also
some worked flints.</p>

<p>We here close our enumeration of the various sources of the
archæological records which have served to reconstruct the history
of primitive man during that period of the stone age which we have
designated under the name of the epoch of the great bear and the
mammoth. Before concluding our remarks as to this period, there is
one question which we must enter upon, although there is a great
deficiency in any positive records by which it might be solved. What
was the organic type of man during this epoch? Could we, for
instance, determine what amount of intellect man possessed in this
earliest and ancient date of his history?</p>

<p>The answer to this question&mdash;although a very uncertain answer&mdash;has
been supposed to have been found in the caves of Engis and
Engihoul, of which we have just spoken as having been explored by
Schmerling with such valuable results.</p>

<p>The cave of Engis contained the remains of three human beings,
among which were two skulls, one that of a youth, the other that of
an adult. The latter only was preserved, the former having fallen
into dust while it was being extracted from the ground. Two small
fragments of a human skull were likewise found at Engihoul; also a
great many of the bones of the hands and feet of three individuals.</p>

<p>The Engis skull has been a subject of protracted argument to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"> [Pg 79]</a></span>
palæontologists and anatomists of the present day. Floods of ink
have been spilt upon the question; discussions without end have
taken place with respect to this piece of bone, in order to fix
accurately the amount of intellect possessed by the inhabitants of
Belgium during the epoch of the great bear and the mammoth. Up
to a certain point the development of the brain may, in fact, be
ascertained from the shape of the cranial envelope, and it is well
known that a remarkable similarity exists between the cerebral
capacity and the intellectual development of all mammiferous animals.
But in a question of this kind we must carefully avoid a quicksand
on which anthropologists too often make shipwreck; this danger
consists in basing a theory on a too limited number of elements, and
of generalising conclusions which are perhaps drawn from one special
case. Because we find a portion of a skull&mdash;not even a whole skull&mdash;belonging
to a human being contemporary with the great bear, we
assume that we can determine the amount of intellect possessed by
man during this epoch. But what proof have we that this skull is
not that of an idiot, or, on the contrary, the skull of an individual
possessing a superior degree of intelligence? What deduction can
be logically drawn from the examination of one single skull? None
whatever! "<i>Testis unus testis nullus</i>;" and what is said by jurisprudence,
which is nothing but good sense in legal matters&mdash;science,
which is nothing but good sense in learned questions, ought likewise
to repeat. If we found ten or twelve skulls, each presenting the
same characteristics, we should be justified in thinking that we had
before our eyes the human type corresponding to the epoch we are
considering; but, we again ask, what arguments could be based on a
few fragments of one single skull?</p>

<p>These reservations having been laid down, let us see what some of
our great anatomical reasoners have thought about the Engis skull.</p>

<p>The representation which we here give (fig. 37) of the Engis skull
was taken from the cast in the Museum of Saint-Germain, and we
may perceive from it that the skull is not complete; the entire base of
the skull is wanting, and all the bones of the face have disappeared.
Consequently it is impossible either to measure the facial angle or to
take account of the development of the lower jaw.</p>

<p class="topspace2">We shall not, therefore, surprise any of our readers when we state
that the opinions on this subject differ in the most extraordinary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"> [Pg 80]</a></span>
degree. In the eyes of Professor Huxley, the English anatomist,
this skull offers no indication of degradation; it presents "a good
average," and it might just as well be the head of a philosopher as
the head of an uncivilised savage. To others&mdash;for instance, to Carl
Vogt&mdash;it indicates an altogether rudimentary degree of intellect.</p>

<p>Thus Hippocrates-Huxley says <i>yes</i>, Galen-Vogt says <i>no</i>, and
Celsus-Lyell says neither <i>yes</i> nor <i>no</i>. This causes us but little
surprise, but it induces us not to waste more time in discussing a
question altogether in the dark, that is, upon altogether incomplete data.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 38.&mdash;Portion of the so-called
Neanderthal Skull.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">We will now turn our attention to another skull, equally celebrated,
which was found in 1857 by Dr. Fuhlrott, near Dusseldorf,
in a deep ravine known by the name of Neanderthal. This skull
(fig. 38) was discovered in the midst of a small cave under a layer
of mud about 5 feet in thickness. The entire skeleton was doubtless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"> [Pg 81]</a></span>
buried on the same spot, but the workmen engaged in clearing
out the cave must have inadvertently scattered a great portion
of the bones, for the largest only could be collected.</p>

<p>It is well to call attention to the fact that no animal remains were
found near these bones; there is, therefore, no certain proof that the latter
can be assigned to the epoch of the great bear: they might, in fact, be
either more recent or more modern. Most geologists are, however, of
opinion that they ought to be referred to the above-named early date.</p>

<p>The Neanderthal skull, of which we possess even a smaller portion
than of the preceding, differs from the Engis skull. It is characterised
by an extraordinary development of the frontal sinuses; that is, by
an enormous projection of the superciliary ridges, behind which the
frontal bone presents a considerable depression. The cranium is very
thick, and of an elongated elliptical shape; the forehead is narrow
and low.</p>

<p>These remarks were made by Professor Schaaffhausen, who also
established the fact of the identity in length of the femur, the
humerus, the radius, and the ulna, with the same bones of a modern
European of equal size. But the Prussian <i>savant</i> was surprised at
the really remarkable thickness of these bones, and also at the large
development of the projections and depressions which served for the
insertion of the muscles.</p>

<p>Fig. 38 represents this skull, which is drawn from the cast in the
Museum of St. Germain.</p>

<p>Professor Schaaffhausen's opinion with regard to this skull is, that it
manifests a degree of intelligence more limited than that of the races
of negroes who are least favoured by nature, in other words, it approaches
the nature of the beast more nearly than any other known
human skull. But, on the other hand, Mr. Busk and Dr. Barnard
Davis look upon this skull as very closely allied to the present race of
men; and Professor Gratiolet produced before the Anthropological
Society of Paris an idiot's head of the present day, which showed all
the osteological characteristics peculiar to the Neanderthal skull.
Lastly, an anthropologist of great authority, Dr. Pruner-Bey, has
brought forward all requisite evidence to prove that the Neanderthal
skull is identical, in all its parts, with the cranium of the Celt.</p>

<p>We see, therefore, that the opinion propounded by Dr. Schaaffhausen
at the commencement of his studies was not able to stand its ground
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"> [Pg 82]</a></span>
before the opposition resulting from subsequent labours on the point;
and that this head of a man belonging to the epoch of the great bear
and mammoth, which he regarded as manifesting the most limited
amount of intelligence, differed in no way from the heads belonging to
Celts of historic times, whose moral qualities and manly courage make
Frenchmen proud to call themselves their descendants.</p>

<p>We need scarcely add that the examination of this latter skull,
which dated back to the first origin of mankind, is sufficient to set at
naught all that has been written as to the pretended analogy of
structure existing between primitive man and the ape, and to wipe
out for ever from scientific phraseology the improper and unhappy term
<i>fossil man</i>, which has not only been the cause of so many lamentable
misunderstandings, but has also too long arrested the formation and
the progress of the science of the first starting-point of man.</p>

<p>Other remains of human skulls, appearing to date back to a very
ancient epoch, have been found in various countries, since the discovery
of those above-named. We will mention, a jaw-bone found by
M. Édouard Dupont in the cave of Naulette, near Dinant, in Belgium&mdash;a
frontal and parietal bone, extracted from the <i>Lehm</i> in the
valley of the Rhine, at Eggisheim near Colmar, by Dr. Faudel&mdash;a
skull found by Professor Bocchi, of Florence, in the Olmo pass, near
Arezzo&mdash;lastly, the celebrated jaw-bone from Moulin-Quignon, near
Abbeville, found in 1863 by Boucher de Perthes, in the <i>diluvium</i>, of
which bone we have given an illustration in the introduction to this
volume. It is acknowledged by all anthropologists that this portion
of the skull of the man of Moulin-Quignon bears a perfect resemblance
to that of a man of small size of the present age.</p>

<p>From the small number of skulls which we possess, it is impossible
for us to estimate what was the precise degree of intelligence to be
ascribed to man at the epoch of the great bear and mammoth. No
one, assuredly, will be surprised at the fact, that the human skull in
these prodigiously remote ages did not present any external signs of
great intellectual development. The nature of man is eminently improvable;
it is, therefore, easily to be understood, that in the earliest
ages of his appearance on the earth his intelligence should have been
of a limited character. Time and progress were destined both to
improve and extend it; the flame of the first-lighted torch was to be
expanded with the lapse of centuries!</p>

Reindeer.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have now arrived at that subdivision of the stone age which we
designate by the name of the <i>Reindeer Epoch</i>, or the <i>Epoch of
migrated animals</i>. Many ages have elapsed since the commencement
of the quaternary geological epoch. The mighty animals which
characterised the commencement of this period have disappeared, or
are on the point of becoming extinct. The great bear (<i>Ursus spelæus</i>)
and the cave-hyæna (<i>Hyæna spelæa</i>) will soon cease to tread the soil
of our earth. It will not be long before the final term will be completed
of the existence of the cave-lion (<i>Felis spelæa</i>), the mammoth,
and the <i>Rhinoceros tichorhinus</i>. Created beings diminish in size as
they improve in type.</p>

<p>To make up for these losses, numerous herds of reindeer now inhabit
the forests of western Europe. In that part of the continent
which was one day to be called France, these animals make their way
as far as the Pyrenees. The horse (<i>Equus caballus</i>), in no way different
from the present species, is the companion of the above-named
valuable ruminant; also the bison (<i>Biso europæus</i>), the urus (<i>Bos
primigenius</i>), the musk-ox (<i>Ovibos moschatus</i>), the elk, the deer, the
chamois, the ibex, and various species of rodents, amongst others, the
beaver, the hamster-rat, the lemming, the spermophilus, &amp;c.</p>

<p>After the intense cold of the glacial period the temperature has
become sensibly milder, but it is still much lower than at the present
day in the same countries; as the reindeer, an animal belonging to a
hyperborean climate, can both enjoy life and multiply in the comparatively
southern part of Europe.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"> [Pg 86]</a></span></p>
<p>The general composition of the <i>fauna</i> which we have just described
is a striking proof of the rigorous cold which still characterised
the climate of central Europe. Animals which then inhabited
those countries are now only met with in the high northern latitudes
of the old and new worlds, in close proximity to the ice and snow, or
on the lofty summits of great mountain-chains. To localities of this
kind have now retired the reindeer, the musk-ox, the elk, the chamois,
the wild-goat, the hamster-rat, the lemming and the spermophilus.
The beaver, too, is at the present day confined almost entirely to
Canada.</p>

<p>Mr. Christy, an English naturalist, has remarked with much acuteness
that the accumulations of bones and other organic remains in
caves actually imply the existence of a rigorous climate. Under the
influence of even a merely moderate temperature, these accumulations
of bones and animal remains would, in fact, have given forth putrid
exhalations which would have prevented any human being from living
in close contiguity to these infectious heaps. The Esquimaux of the
present day live, in this respect, very much like the people of primitive
ages, that is, close by the side of the most fetid <i>débris</i>; but, except in
the cold regions of the north, they would be quite unable to do this.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 39.&mdash;Man of the Reindeer Epoch.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">What progress was made by the man of the reindeer epoch (fig. 39)
beyond that attained by his ancestors? This is the question we are
about to consider. But we must confine the sphere of our study to
the only two countries in which a sufficient number of investigations
have been made in respect to the epoch of the reindeer. We allude to
that part of Europe which nowadays forms France and Belgium.</p>

<p>During the reindeer epoch, man wrought the flint to better effect
than in the preceding period. He also manufactured somewhat
remarkable implements in bone, ivory, and reindeers' horn. In the
preceding period, human bones were found in caves, mixed up indiscriminately
with those of animals; in the epoch we are now considering,
this promiscuous intermingling is no longer met with.</p>

<p>We shall first pass in review man as existing in this epoch, in
respect to his habitation and food. We shall then proceed to speak of
the productions of his industry, and also of the earliest essays of his
artistic genius. Lastly, we shall briefly consider his physical organisation.</p>

<p>With respect to his habitation, man, during the reindeer epoch,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"> [Pg 87]</a></span>
still took up his abode in caves. According to their depth and the
light penetrating them, he either occupied the whole extent of them
or established himself in the outlet only. About the centre of the
cavern some slabs of stone, selected from the hardest rocks, such as
sandstone or slate, were bedded down in the ground, and formed the
hearth for cooking his food. During the long nights of winter the
whole family must have assembled round this hearth.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in order the better to defend himself against the various
surprises to which he was exposed, the man of the reindeer epoch
selected a cavern with a very narrow inlet which could only be entered
by climbing.</p>

<p>A cave formed naturally in the deepest clefts and hollows of some
rock constituted, in every climate, the earliest habitation of man.
In cold climates it was necessary for him to find some retreat in which
to pass the night, and in warmer latitudes he had to ward off the heat
of the day. But these natural dwellings could only be met with in
districts where rocks existed which offered facilities for cover in the
way of clefts and holes. When man took up his abode in a level
country, he was compelled to construct for himself some place of
shelter. By collecting together stones, brought from various directions,
he then managed to build an artificial cavern. Choosing a spot where
some natural projection overhung the ground, he enlarged, as far as
he was able, this natural roof, and, bringing art to the assistance of
nature, he ultimately found himself in possession of a convenient
retreat.</p>

<p>We must not omit to add that the spot in which he established his
dwelling was always in the vicinity of some running stream.</p>

<p>In this way, therefore, the inhabitants of the plains formed their
habitations during the epoch which we are considering.</p>

<p>We have, also, certain proofs that primitive tribes, during this
period, did not take up their abode in natural caverns exclusively, but
that they were able to make for themselves more convenient sheltering-places
under the cover of some great overhanging rock. In various
regions of France, especially in Périgord, numerous ancient open-air
human settlements have been discovered. They must have been mere
sheds or places of shelter, leaning against the base of some high
cliff, and protected against the inclemency of the weather by projections
of the rock which, more or less, hung over them, forming a kind of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"> [Pg 88]</a></span>
roof. The name of <i>rock-shelters</i> has been given to these dwellings of
primitive man.</p>

<p>These wild retreats are generally met with in the lower part of
some valley in close proximity to a running stream. They, like the
caverns, contain very rich deposits of the bones of mammals, birds and
fishes, and also specimens of hatchets and utensils made of flint, bone,
and horn. Traces of hearths are also discovered.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable of these natural shelters belonging to
the reindeer epoch has been discovered at Bruniquel, in the department
of Tarn-et-Garonne, not far from Montauban.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord topspace2"><a name="i_122.jpg" id="i_122.jpg"></a>

<div class="caption">Fig. 40.&mdash;Rock-shelter at Bruniquel, a
supposed Habitation of Man during the Reindeer Epoch.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">On the left bank of the river Aveyron, under the overhanging
shelter of one of the highest rocks of Bruniquel and in close proximity
to a <i>château</i>, the picturesque ruins of which still stand on the brow of
the cliff above, there was discovered, in 1866, a fire-hearth of the pre-historic
period; this hearth and its surroundings have afforded us the
most complete idea of one of the rock-shelters of man during the
reindeer epoch.</p>

<p>This rock, known by the name of Montastruc, is about 98 feet high,
and it overhangs the ground below for an extent of 46 to 49 feet.
It covers an area of 298 square yards. In this spot, M. V. Brun, the
Director of the Museum of Natural History at Montauban, found
a host of objects of various descriptions, the study of which has
furnished many useful ideas for the history of this epoch of primitive
humanity.</p>

<p>By taking advantage of the photographic views of the pre-historic
settlement of Bruniquel, which M. V. Brun has been kind enough to
forward to us, we have been enabled to compose the sketch which is
presented in fig. 40 of a rock-shelter, or an open-air settlement of man
in the reindeer epoch.</p>

<p>Men during the reindeer epoch did not possess any notion of agriculture.
They had not as yet subdued and domesticated any animal
so as to profit by its strength, or to ensure by its means a constant
supply of food. They were, therefore, like their forefathers, essentially
hunters; and pursued wild animals, killing them with their spears or
arrows. The reindeer was the animal which they chiefly attacked.
This mammal, which then existed all over Europe, in the centre as
well as in the south (although it has now retired or migrated into the
regions of the extreme north), was for the man of this period all that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"> [Pg 89]</a></span>
it nowadays is to the Laplander&mdash;the most precious gift of nature.
They fed upon its flesh and made their garments of its skin, utilising
its tendons as thread in the preparation of their dress; its bones and
its antlers they converted into all kinds of weapons and implements.
Reindeer's horn was the earliest raw material in the manufactures of
these remote ages, and to the man of this epoch was all that iron is
to us.</p>

<p>The horse, the ox, the urus, the elk, the ibex, and the chamois,
all formed a considerable part of the food of men during this
epoch. They were in the habit of breaking the long bones and the
skulls of the recently-killed animals, in order to extract the marrow
and the brain, which they ate all steaming with the natural animal
heat, as is done in the present day by certain tribes in the Arctic
regions. The meat of this animal was cooked on their rough
hearths; for they did not eat it raw as some naturalists have asserted.
The animal bones which have been found, intermingled with human
remains, in the caverns of this epoch bear evident traces of the action
of fire.</p>

<p>To this animal prey they occasionally added certain birds, such as
the great heath-cock, willow-grouse, owl, &amp;c. When this kind of
game fell short, they fell back upon the rat. Round the hearthstone,
in the cave of Chaleux, M. Dupont found more than twenty pounds
weight of the bones of water-rats, half roasted.</p>

<p>Fish is an article of food which has always been much sought after
by man. By mere inference we might, therefore, readily imagine that
man during the reindeer epoch fed on fish as well as the flesh of
animals, even if the fact were not attested by positive evidence. This
evidence is afforded by the remains of fish-bones which are met with
in the caves of this epoch, intermingled with the bones of mammals,
and also by sketches representing parts of fishes, which are found
roughly traced on a great number of fragments of bone and horn
implements.</p>

<p>The art of fishing, therefore, must certainly have been in existence
during the reindeer epoch. We cannot assert that it was practised
during that of the great bear and the mammoth; but, as regards the
period we are now considering, no doubt can be entertained on the
point. In an article on the 'Origine de la Navigation et de la Pêche,'
M. G. de Mortillet expresses himself as follows:</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"> [Pg 90]</a></span></p>
<p>"The epoch of the reindeer presents to our notice several specimens
of fishing-tackle. The most simple is a little splinter of bone, generally
about one to two inches long, straight, slender, and pointed at
both ends. This is the primitive and elementary fish-hook. This
small fragment of bone or reindeer horn was fastened by the middle
and covered with a bait; when swallowed by a fish, or even by an
aquatic bird, it became fixed in the interior of the body by one of the
pointed ends, and the voracious creature found itself caught by the
cord attached to the primitive hook. At the museum of Saint-Germain,
there are several of these hooks which came from the rich deposits of
Bruniquel, near Montauban (Tarn-et-Garonne).</p>

<p>"Hooks belonging to the reindeer epoch have also been found in
the caves and retreats of Dordogne, so well explored by MM. Lartet
and Christy. Along with those of the simple form which we have
just described, others were met with of a much more perfect shape.
These are likewise small fragments of bone or reindeer's horn, with
deep and wide notches on one side, forming a more or less developed
series of projecting and sharp teeth, or barbs. Two of them are
depicted in <span class="smcap">Plate B</span>, VI. of the 'Reliquiæ Aquitanicæ.' M. Lartet
is in possession of several of them; but the most remarkable specimen
forms a part of the beautiful collection of M. Peccadeau de l'Isle, of
Paris."<a name="fnanchor_7" id="fnanchor_7"></a><a href="#footnote_7"
class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>There are strong reasons for believing that man during this epoch
did not confine himself to a diet of an exclusively carnivorous character,
for vegetable food is in perfect harmony with the organisation
of our species. By means of wild fruits, acorns, and chestnuts, he
must have introduced some little variety into his ordinary system of
sustenance.</p>

<p>From the data which we have been considering, we furnish, in
fig. 41, a representation of <i>a feast during the reindeer epoch</i>. Men
are engaged in cleaving the head of a urus, in order to extract and
devour the smoking brains. Others, sitting round the fire in which
the flesh of the same animal is being cooked, are sucking out the
marrow from the long bones of the reindeer, which they have
broken by blows with a hatchet.</p>

<p class="topspace2">It becomes a very interesting question to know whether the men of
these remote periods practised cannibalism or not. On this point we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"> [Pg 91]</a></span>
have as yet no certain information. We will, however, state some
facts which seem to make in favour of this idea.</p>

<p>Human skulls have been found in Scotland mixed up promiscuously
with sculptured flints, remains of pottery, and children's bones; on
the latter, Professor Owen thinks that he can recognise the trace of
human teeth.</p>

<p>At Solutré, in Mâconnais, M. de Ferry has discovered human finger-joints
among the remains of cooking of the epoch of the great bear
and mammoth, and of that of the reindeer.</p>

<p>The appearance of certain bones from the caves of Ariége, dug
up by MM. Garrigou and Filhol, has led both these <i>savants</i> to the
opinion "that pre-historic man may have been anthropophagous."</p>

<p>The same conclusion would be arrived at from the explorations
which have been undertaken in the grottos and caves of Northern
Italy by M. Costa de Beauregard. This latter <i>savant</i> found in
the caves the small shin-bone of a child which had been carefully
emptied and cleansed, leading to the idea that the marrow had been
eaten.</p>

<p>At a point near Finale, on the road from Genoa to Nice, in a vast
cave which was for a long period employed as a habitation for our
race, M. Issel discovered some human bones which had evidently been
calcined. Their whitish colour, their lightness, and their friability
left no room for doubt on the point. Added to this, the incrustations
on their surface still contained small fragments of carbon. Moreover,
many of the bones showed notches which could not have been made
without the help of some sharp instrument.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, probable that men in the stone age practised
anthropophagy; we have, really, no cause to be surprised at this;
since, in our own days, various savage tribes are addicted to cannibalism,
under a considerable diversity of circumstances.</p>

<p>Not the least trace has been discovered of animals' bones being
gnawed by dogs in any of the human settlements during the reindeer
epoch. Man, therefore, had not as yet reduced the dog to a state
of domesticity.</p>

<p>How did primitive man dress himself during this epoch? He must
have made garments out of the skins of the quadrupeds which he
killed in hunting, and especially of the reindeer's hide. There can
be no doubt on this point. A large number of reindeers' antlers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"> [Pg 92]</a></span>
found in Périgord have at their base certain cuts which evidently
could only have been produced in flaying the animal.</p>

<p>It is no less certainly proved that these men knew how to prepare
animals' skins by clearing them of their hair, and that they were no
longer compelled, like their ancestors, to cover themselves with rough
bear-skins still covered with their fur. To what purpose could they
have applied the flint scrapers which are met with everywhere in
such abundance, except for scraping the hair off the skins of wild
beasts? Having thus taken off the hair, they rendered them supple
by rubbing them in with brains and the marrow extracted from the
long bones of the reindeer. Then they cut them out into some very
simple patterns, which are, of course, absolutely unknown to us;
and, finally, they joined together the different pieces by rough
sewing.</p>

<p>The fact that man at this epoch knew how to sew together reindeer
skins so as to convert them into garments, is proved by the discovery
of numerous specimens of instruments which must have been
used for this work; these are&mdash;and this is most remarkable&mdash;exactly
the same as those employed nowadays by the Laplanders, for the
same purpose. They consist of bodkins or stilettoes made of flint
and bone (fig. 42), by means of which the holes were pierced in the
skin; also very carefully fashioned needles, mostly of bone or
horn (fig. 43).</p>

<p class="topspace2">The inspection of certain reindeer bones has likewise enabled us to
recognise the fact that the men of this age used for thread the sinewy
fibres of this animal. On these bones transverse cuts may be noticed,
just in those very spots where the section of the tendon must have
taken place.</p>

<p>No metal was as yet known; consequently, man continued to make
use of stone instruments, both for the implements of labour, and also
for offensive and defensive weapons. The hatchet was but little
employed as a weapon of war, and the flint-knife was the arm most
extensively used. We must add to this, another potent although
natural weapon; this was the lower jaw-bone of the great bear, still
retaining its sharp and pointed canine tooth. The elongated and
solid bone furnished the handle, and the sharp tooth the formidable
point; and with this instrument man could in the chase attack and
pierce any animal with which he entered into a hand-to-hand conflict.</p>

<p>It may be noticed that this weapon is placed in the hand of the
man in fig. 39, which represents him during the reindeer epoch.</p>

<p>It must certainly be the case that the human race possesses to a
very high degree the taste for personal ornament, since objects used
for adornment are found in the most remote ages of mankind and in
every country. There can be no doubt that the men and women who
lived in the reindeer epoch sacrificed
to the graces. In the midst of their
precarious mode of life, the idea entered
into their minds of manufacturing
necklaces, bracelets, and pendants,
either with shells which they bored
through the middle so as to be able
to string them as beads, or with the
teeth of various animals which they
pierced with holes with the same intention,
as represented in fig. 44.</p>

</div>

<p class="topspace2">The horny portion of the ear of the
horse or ox (fig. 45), was likewise used
for the same purpose, that is, as an
object of adornment.</p>

<p class="topspace2">It becomes a question whether man
at this epoch had any belief in a future life, and practised anything
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"> [Pg 94]</a></span>
which bore a resemblance to religious worship. The existence,
round the fire-hearths of the burial-caverns in Belgium, of large fossil
elephant (mammoth's) bones&mdash;a fact which has been pointed out by
M. Édouard Dupont&mdash;gives us some reason for answering this question
in the affirmative. According to M. Morlot, the practice of
placing bones round caverns still survives, as a religious idea,
among the Indians. We may, therefore, appeal to this discovery as
a hint in favour of the existence of some religious feeling among the
men who lived during the reindeer epoch.</p>

<p>In the tombs of this epoch are found the weapons and knives
which men carried during their lifetime, and sometimes even a supply
of the flesh of animals used for food. This custom of placing near
the body of the dead provisions for the journey to be taken <i>post
mortem</i> is, as remarked in reference to the preceding period, the
proof of a belief in another life.</p>

<p>Certain religious, or rather superstitious, ideas may have been
attached to some glittering stones and bright fragments of ore
which have been picked up in several settlements of these primitive
tribes. M. de Vibraye found at Bourdeilles (Charente), two nodules
of hydrated oxide of iron mixed with <i>débris</i> of all kinds; and at
the settlement of Laugerie-Basse (Dordogne), in the middle of the
hearth, a small mass of copper covered with a layer of green carbonate.
In other spots there have been met with pieces of jet, violet
fluor, &amp;c., pierced through the middle, doubtless to enable them to
be suspended to the neck and ears. The greater part of these
objects may possibly be looked upon as amulets, that is, symbols
of some religious beliefs entertained by man during the reindeer
epoch.</p>

<p>The social instinct of man, the feeling which compels him to form
an alliance with his fellow-man, had already manifested itself at this
early period. Communication was established between localities at
some considerable distance from one another. Thus it was that the
inhabitants of the banks of the Lesse in Belgium travelled as far as
that part of France which is now called Champagne, in order to seek
the flints which they could not find in their own districts, although
they were indispensable to them in order to manufacture their
weapons and implements. They likewise brought back fossil shells,
of which they made fantastical necklaces. This distant intercourse
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"> [Pg 95]</a></span>
cannot be called in question, for certain evidences of it can be
adduced. M. Édouard Dupont found in the cave of Chaleux, near
Dinant (Belgium), fifty-four of these shells, which are not found
naturally anywhere else than in Champagne. Here, therefore, we
have the rudiments of commerce, that is, of the importation and
exchange of commodities which form its earliest manifestations in all
nations of the world.</p>

<p>Again, it may be stated that there existed at this epoch real manufactories
of weapons and utensils, the productions of which were distributed
around the neighbouring country according to the particular
requirements of each family. The cave of Chaleux, which was
mentioned above, seems to have been one of these places of manufacture;
for from the 8th to the 30th of May, during twenty-two
days only, there were collected at this spot nearly 20,000 flints
chipped into hatchets, daggers, knives, scrapers, scratchers, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Workshops of this kind were established in
the settlements of Laugerie-Basse and Laugerie-Haute
in Périgord. The first was to all appearance
a special manufactory for spear-heads, some
specimens of which have been found by MM.
Lartet and Christy of an extremely remarkable
nature; exact representations of them are delineated
in fig. 46. In the second were fabricated
weapons and implements of reindeers' horn, if we
may judge by the large quantity of remains of the
antlers of those animals, which were met with by
these <i>savants</i>, almost all of which bear the marks
of sawing.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 46.&mdash;Spear-head found

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">It is not, however, probable that the objects
thus manufactured were exported to any great
distance, as was subsequently the case, that is,
in the polished stone epoch. How would it be
possible to cross great rivers, and to pass through
wide tracts overgrown with thick forests, in order
to convey far and wide these industrial products; at a time, too, when
no means of communication existed between one country and another?
But it is none the less curious to be able to verify the existence of a
rudimentary commerce exercised at so remote an epoch.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"> [Pg 96]</a></span></p>
<p>The weapons, utensils and implements which were used by man
during the reindeer epoch testify to a decided progress having been
made beyond those of the preceding period. The implements are
made of flint, bone, or horn; but the latter kind are much the most
numerous, chiefly in the primitive settlements in the centre and south
of France. Those of Périgord are especially remarkable for the
abundance of instruments made of reindeers' bones.</p>

<p>The great diversity of type in the wrought flints furnishes a very
evident proof of the long duration of the historical epoch we are considering.
In the series of these instruments we can trace all the
phases of improvement in workmanship, beginning with the rough
shape of the hatchets found in the <i>diluvium</i> at Abbeville, and culminating
in those elegant spear-heads which are but little inferior to
any production of later times.</p>


<p>We here give representations (fig. 47, 48, 49, 50), of the most
curious specimens of the stone and flint weapons of the reindeer epoch.
Knives and other small instruments, such as scrapers, piercers, borers,
&amp;c., form the great majority; hatchets are comparatively rare. Instruments
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"> [Pg 97]</a></span>
are also met with which might be used for a double purpose,
for instance, borers and also piercers. There are also round stones
which must have been used as hammers; it may, at least, be noticed
that they have received repeated blows.</p>

<p class="topspace2">Sir J. Lubbock is of opinion that some of these stones were employed
in heating water, after they had been made red-hot in the fire.
According to the above-named author, this plan of procuring hot
water is still adopted among certain savage tribes who are still
ignorant of the art of pottery, and possess nothing but wooden vessels,
which cannot be placed over a fire.<a name="fnanchor_8" id="fnanchor_8"></a>
<a href="#footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>We must also mention the polishers formed of sandstone or some
other material with a rough surface. They could only be used for
polishing bone and horn, as the reindeer epoch does not admit of
instruments of polished stone.</p>

<p>There have also been collected here and there pebbles of granite or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"> [Pg 98]</a></span>
quartzite hollowed out at the centre, and more or less perfectly rounded
on the edges. It has been conjectured that these were mortars,
although their small dimensions scarcely countenance this hypothesis.
Neither is it probable that they were used for pounding seed, as
fancied by M. de Vibraye. Nor does the idea which has been
entertained of their being used for producing fire seem to have any
sufficient ground.</p>

<p>Among the most interesting specimens in the vast collection of
flints belonging to the reindeer epoch which have been found in the
countries of France and Belgium, we must mention the delicate and
very finely-toothed double-edged saws. The one we here represent
(fig. 51) is in the Archæological Museum of Saint-Germain. It does
not measure more than three-quarters of an inch in
length, and about one-tenth of an inch in width.
It was found by M. V. Brun in one of the <i>rock-shelters</i>
at Bruniquel.</p>

<div class="figcenter topspace2"><a name="i_135.jpg" id="i_135.jpg"></a>

<div class="caption">Fig. 51.&mdash;Small Flint Saw, found in the

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">Saws of this kind were, no doubt, employed for
fashioning the antlers of the reindeer, and other
ruminants that shed their horns. The antler was
cut into on each side, and the fracture was finished
by hand.</p>

<p>The objects of bone and reindeer-horn found in
the caves of Périgord show a still greater variety,
and a no less remarkable skilfulness in workmanship.</p>

<p>We may mention, for instance, the arrow and
javelin-heads. Some are slender and tapering off at
both ends; in others, the base terminates in a single
or double bevel. Among the latter, the greater
part seem made to fix in a cleft stick; some are ornamented with
lines and hatching over their surface. Others have notches in them,
somewhat similar to an attempt at barbing.</p>

</div>

<p class="topspace2">We now come to the barbed dart-heads, designated by the name
of <i>harpoons</i>. They taper-off considerably towards the top, and are
characterised by very decided barbs, shaped like hooks, and distributed
sometimes on one side only, and sometimes on both (figs. 53, 54).
In the latter case the barbs are arranged in pairs, and are provided
with a small furrow or middle groove, which, according to some
naturalists, was intended to hold some subtle poison. Like the present
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"> [Pg 99]</a></span>
race of Indians of the American forests, primitive man may
possibly have poisoned his arrows; and the longitudinal groove, which
is noticed in so many reindeer arrow-heads, may have served to contain
the poison.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 54&mdash;Arrow of Reindeer Horn

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">We must not, however, fail to state that this opinion has been
abandoned since it has been ascertained that the North American
Indians used in former times to hunt the bison with wooden arrows
furnished with grooves or channels of a similar character. These
channels are said to have been intended to give a freer vent to the
flow of the animal's blood, which was thus, so to speak, sucked out of
the wound. This may, therefore, have been the intention of the
grooves which are noticed on the dart-heads of the reindeer epoch, and
the idea of their having been poisoned must be dismissed.</p>

<p>These barbed darts or harpoons are still used by the Esquimaux of
the present day, in pursuing the seal. Such arrows, like those of
the primitive hordes of the reindeer epoch which are represented
above (figs. 53, 54), are sharply pointed and provided with barbs;
they are fastened to a string and shot from a bow. The Esquimaux
sometimes attach an inflated bladder to the extremity of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"> [Pg 100]</a></span>
arrow, so that the hunter may be apprized whether he has hit his
mark, or in order to show in what direction he should aim again.</p>

<p>We give here (fig. 55) a drawing of a fragment of bone found in
the cave of Les Eyzies (Périgord); a portion of one of these harpoons
remains fixed in the bone.</p>

<p class="topspace2">We must assign to the class of implements the bone bodkins or
stilettoes of different sizes, either with or without a handle (figs. 56, 57),
and also a numerous series of needles found in the caves of
Périgord, some of which are very slender and elegant, and made of
bone, horn, and even ivory. In some of the human settlements of the
reindeer epoch, bones have been found, from which long splinters had
been detached, fitted for the fabrication of needles. The delicate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"> [Pg 101]</a></span>
points of flint have also been found which were used to bore the eyes
of the needles, and, lastly, the lumps of sandstone on which the latter
were polished.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">We must, likewise, point out the <i>smoothers</i>, intended to flatten
down the seams in the skins used for garments.</p>

<p>One of the most important instruments of this epoch is a perfect
drill with a sharpened point and cutting edge. With this flint point
rapidly twirled round, holes could be bored in any kind of material&mdash;bone,
teeth, horn, or shells. This stone drill worked as well as our
tool made of steel, according to the statement of certain naturalists
who have tried the effect of them.</p>

<p>The primitive human settlement at Laugerie-Basse
has furnished several specimens of an instrument,
the exact use of which has not been ascertained.
They are rods, tapering off at one end,
and hollowed out at the other in the shape of a
spoon. M. Édouard Lartet has propounded the
opinion that they were used by the tribes of this
epoch as spoons, in order to extract the marrow
from the long bones of the animals which were
used for their food. M. Lartet would not, however,
venture to assert this, and adds: "It is, perhaps,
probable that our primitive forefathers would not
have taken so much trouble." Be this as it may,
one of these instruments is very remarkable for the
lines and ornaments in relief with which it is decorated,
testifying to the existence in the workman of
some feeling of symmetry (fig. 58).</p>

<p class="topspace2">In various caves&mdash;at Les Eyzies, Laugerie-Basse,
and Chaffant, <i>commune</i> of Savigné (Vienne)&mdash;whistles
of a peculiar kind have been found (fig. 59). They
are made from the first joint of the foot of the
reindeer or some other ruminant of the stag genus. A
hole has been bored in the base of the bone, a little in
front of the metatarsal joint. If one blows into this
hole, placing the lower lip in the hollow answering
to the above-named joint, a shrill sound is produced,
similar to that made by blowing into a piped key. We ourselves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"> [Pg 102]</a></span>
have had the pleasure of verifying the fact, at the Museum of Saint-Germain,
that these primitive whistles act very well.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">The settlements at Périgord have also furnished a certain number
of staves made of reindeer horn (figs. 60, 61), the proper functions
of which no one has succeeded in properly explaining. They are
invariably bored with one or more holes at the base, and are covered
with designs to which we shall hereafter refer. M. Lartet has thought
that they were perhaps symbols or staves of authority.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 61.&mdash;Another Staff of

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">This explanation appears the correct one when we consider the
care with which these bâtons were fashioned. If the hypothesis of
their being symbols of authority be adopted, the varying number of
the holes would not be without intention; it might point to some
kind of hierarchy, the highest grade of which corresponded to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"> [Pg 103]</a></span>
bâton with the most holes. Thus, in the Chinese empire, the degree
of a mandarin's authority is estimated by the number of buttons on
his silk cap. And just as in the Mussulman hierarchy there were
pachas of from one to three tails, so it may be fancied that among
primitive man of the reindeer epoch there were chiefs of from one to
three holes!</p>

<p>We have already stated that in the epoch of the great bear and
the mammoth the art of manufacturing a rough description of
pottery was, perhaps, known in Europe. The men of the reindeer
epoch made, however, but little progress in this respect. Nevertheless,
if certain relics really belong to this period, they may have known
how to make rough vessels, formed of clay, mixed with sand, and
hardened by the action of fire. This primitive art was, as yet,
anything but generally adopted: for we very rarely find <i>débris</i> of
pottery in close contiguity with other remains of the reindeer epoch.</p>

<p>The Archæological Museum of Saint Germain is in possession
of a hollow vessel, a natural geode, very large and very thick
(fig. 62). It was found in the cave of La Madelaine (department
of Dordogne); on one side it has evidently been subjected to the
action of fire, and may therefore be presumed to have been used as a
large vessel for culinary purposes.</p>

<p class="topspace2">In a cave at Furfooz, near Dinant in Belgium, to which we shall
subsequently refer, M. Édouard Dupont found, intermingled with
human bones, an urn, or specimen of rough pottery, which is perhaps
one of the most ancient monuments of the ceramic art as practised by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"> [Pg 104]</a></span>
our primitive ancestors. This urn (fig. 63) was partly broken;
by the care of M. Hauzeur it has been put together again, as we

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">It is in the reindeer epoch that we find the earliest traces of any
artistic feeling manifested in man.</p>

<p>It is a circumstance well worthy of remark, that this feeling appears
to have been the peculiar attribute of the tribes which inhabited the
south-west of the present France; the departments of Dordogne,
Vienne, Charente, Tarn-et-Garonne, and Ariége, are, in fact, the only
localities where designs and carvings representing organised beings
have been discovered. The departments in the east have not furnished
anything of a similar character, any more than Belgium, which
has been so thoroughly explored by M. Édouard Dupont, or Wurtemburg,
where M. Fraas has lately described various settlements of
this primitive epoch.</p>

<p>It is not sufficient to allege, in order to explain this singular circumstance,
that the caves in the south of France belong to a later
period of the reindeer epoch, and that the others go back to the
earliest commencement of the same age. Apart from the fact that
this assertion is in no way proved, a complete and ready answer is
involved in the well verified circumstance, that even in later ages&mdash;in
the polished stone, and even in the bronze epoch&mdash;no representation of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"> [Pg 105]</a></span>
an animal or plant is found to have been executed in these localities.
No specimen of the kind has, in fact, been found in the <i>kitchen-middens</i>
of Denmark, or in the lacustrine settlements of the stone
age, or even of the bronze age.</p>

<p>It must, then, be admitted that the tribes which were scattered
over those portions of the European continent which now correspond
to the south-west of France, possessed a special talent in the art of
design. There is, moreover, nothing unreasonable in such a supposition.
An artistic feeling is not always the offspring of civilisation,
it is rather a gift of nature. It may manifest its existence in
the most barbarous ages, and may make its influence more deeply
felt in nations which are behindhand in respect to general progress
than in others which are much further advanced in civilisation.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the rudiments of engraving and sculpture
of which we are about to take a view, testify to faculties of an
essentially artistic character. Shapes are so well imitated, movements
are so thoroughly caught, as it were, in the sudden fact of action,
that it is almost always possible to recognise the object which the
ancient workman desired to represent, although he had at his disposal
nothing but the rudest instruments for executing his work. A
splinter of flint was his sole graving-tool, a piece of reindeer horn,
or a flake of slate or ivory, was the only plate on which primitive man
could stamp his reproductions of animated nature.</p>

<p>Perhaps they drew on stone or horn with lumps of red-chalk
or ochre, for both these substances have been found in the
caves of primitive man. Perhaps, too, as is the case with modern
savages, the ochre and red-chalk were used besides for painting or
tatooing his body. When the design was thus executed on stone
or horn, it was afterwards engraved with the point of some flint
instrument.</p>

<p>Those persons who have attentively examined the interesting
gallery of the <i>Histoire du Travail</i> in the International Exposition
of 1867, must have remarked a magnificent collection of these artistic
productions of primeval ages. There were no less than fifty-one
specimens, which were exhibited by several collectors, and were for
the most part extremely curious. In his interesting work, 'Promenades
Préhistoriques à l'Exposition Universelle,' M. Gabriel de Mortillet
has carefully described these objects. In endeavouring to obtain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"> [Pg 106]</a></span>
some knowledge of them, we shall take as our guide the learned
curator of the Archæological Museum of Saint-Germain.</p>

<p>We have, in the first place, various representations of the mammoth,
which was still in existence at the commencement of the reindeer
epoch.</p>

<p>The first (fig. 64) is an outline sketch, drawn on a slab of
ivory, from the cave of La Madelaine. When MM. Lartet and
Christy found it, it was broken into five pieces, which they managed
to put together very accurately. The small eye and the curved tusks
of the animal may be perfectly distinguished, as well as its huge
trunk, and even its abundant mane, the latter proving that it is really
the mammoth&mdash;that is the fossil&mdash;and not the present species of
elephant.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 64.&mdash;Sketch of a Mammoth,

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">The second figure is an entire mammoth, graven on a fragment of
reindeer horn, from the rock-shelters of Bruniquel, and belongs to
M. Peccadeau de l'Isle. This figure forms the hilt of a poniard, the
blade of which springs from the front part of the animal. It may be
recognised to be the mammoth by its trunk, its wide flat feet, and
especially by its erect tail, ending in a bunch of hair. In point of
fact, the present species of elephant never sets up the tail, and has no
bunch of hair at the end of it.</p>

<p>A third object brought from the pre-historic station of Laugerie-Basse
(M. de Vibraye's collection) is the lower end of a staff of
authority carved in the form of a mammoth's head. The prominent
forehead, and the body of the animal stretching along the base of the
staff, may both be very distinctly seen.</p>

<p>On another fragment of a staff of authority, found at Bruniquel by
M. V. Brun, the cave-lion (<i>Felis spelæa</i>) is carved with great clearness.
The head, in particular, is perfectly represented.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"> [Pg 107]</a></span></p>
<p>Representations of reindeer, either carved or scratched on stone or
horn, are very common; we mention the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the first place the hilt of a dagger in reindeer's horn (fig. 65)
of the same type as that shaped in the form of a mammoth. This
specimen is remarkable, because the artist has most skilfully adapted
the shape of the animal to the purpose for which the instrument was
intended. The hilt represents a reindeer, which is carved out as if
lying in a very peculiar position; the hind legs are stretched along
the blade, and the front legs are doubled back under the belly, so as
not to hurt the hand of anyone holding the dagger; lastly, the head
is thrown back, the muzzle turned upwards, and the horns flattened
down so as not to interfere with the grasp.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 65.&mdash;Hilt of a Dagger, carved

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">This is, at all events, nothing but a rough sketch. The same
remark, however, does not apply to two ivory daggers found at Bruniquel
by M. Peccadeau de l'Isle. These objects are very artistically
executed, and are the most finished specimens that have been found
up to the present time. Both of them represent a reindeer with the
head thrown back as in the preceding plate; but whilst in one
dagger the blade springs from the hinder part of the body, in the
same way as in the rough-hewn horn, in the other it proceeds
from the front of the body, between the head and the forelegs. The
hind legs are stretched out and meet again at the feet, thus forming
a hole between them, which was probably used as a ring on which to
suspend the dagger.</p>

<p>We must not omit to mention a slab of slate, on which is drawn
in outline a reindeer fight. It was found at Laugerie-Basse by
M. de Vibraye. The artist has endeavoured to portray one of those
furious contests in which the male reindeer engages during
the rutting season, in order to obtain possession of the females; he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"> [Pg 108]</a></span>
has executed his design in a spirited manner, marked by a certain
<i>naïveté</i>.</p>

<p>There are a good many other fragments on which reindeer are
either drawn or carved; we shall not dwell upon them, but add a few
remarks as to several specimens on which are representations of the
stag, the horse, the bison, the ibex, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A representation of a stag (fig. 66) is drawn on a fragment of stag's
horn found in the cave of La Madelaine by MM. Lartet and Christy.
The shape of the antlers, which are very different to those of the reindeer,
leave no doubt as to the identity of the animal.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 66.&mdash;Representation of a Stag, drawn on

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">The ox and the bison are represented in various fashions. We will
mention here a carved head which was found in the cave of Laugerie-Basse
by M. de Vibraye. It forms the base of a staff of authority.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 67.&mdash;Representation of some large herbivorous

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">We must, doubtless, class under the same category a fragment of
reindeer's horn, found at Laugerie-Basse, on which the hind-quarters
of some large herbivorous animal are sketched out with a bold and
practised touch (fig. 67). Various indications have led M. Lartet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"> [Pg 109]</a></span>
to think that the artist has not endeavoured to represent a horse,
as was at first imagined, but a bison of rather a slender shape.
Unfortunately the fragment is broken at the exact spot where the
bushy mane should begin, which characterises the species of the bison
sub-genus.</p>

</div>

<p class="topspace2">In the same locality another fragment of reindeer's horn was found,
on which some horned animal is depicted (fig. 69), which appears
to be an ibex, if we may judge by the lines under the chin which
seem to indicate a beard.</p>

</div>

<p class="topspace2">In the cave of Les Eyzies, in the department of Dordogne, MM.
Lartet and Christy came upon two slabs of quartziferous schist, on
both of which are scratched animal forms which are deficient in any
special characteristics. In one (fig. 70), some have fancied they could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"> [Pg 110]</a></span>
recognise the elk; but, as the front part only of the other has been
preserved, it is almost impossible to determine what mammiferous
animal it is intended to represent. An indistinct trace of horns seems
to indicate a herbivorous animal.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">On each side of a staff of authority made of reindeer's horn, found
by MM. Lartet and Christy in the cave of the Madelaine, may be
noticed three horses in demi-relief, which are very easily recognisable.</p>

<p>On a carved bone, found at Bruniquel by M. de Lastic, the head of
a reindeer and that of a horse are drawn in outline side by side; the
characteristics of both animals are well maintained.</p>

<p>Lastly, we may name a round shaft formed of reindeer's horn
(fig. 71), found at Laugerie-Basse by MM. Lartet and Christy, on
which is carved an animal's head, with ears of a considerable
length laid back upon the head. It is not
easy to determine for what purpose this shaft was
intended; one end being pointed and provided with
a lateral hook. It was perhaps used as a harpoon.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">Representations of birds are more uncommon than
those of mammals.</p>

<p>There are, on the other hand, a good many rough
delineations of fish, principally on the so-called wands
of authority, on which numbers may often be noticed
following one another in a series. We have one
delineation of a fish, skilfully drawn on a fragment
of the lower jaw-bone of a reindeer, which was found
at Laugerie-Basse.</p>

<p>Also in the cave of La Vache (Ariége), M. Garrigou
found a fragment of bone, on which there is a clever
design of a fish.</p>

<p>Very few representations of reptiles have come to
light, and those found are in general badly executed.
We must, however, make an exception in favour of the figure of a
tadpole, scratched out on an arrow-head, found in the cave of the
Madelaine.</p>

<p>Designs representing flowers are very rare; in the <i>Galerie du
Travail</i>, at the Exposition, only three specimens are exhibited; they
came from La Madelaine and Laugerie-Basse, and were all three
graven on spear-heads.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"> [Pg 111]</a></span></p>
<p>But did the men of the reindeer epoch make no attempts to portray
their own personal appearance? Have not the excavations dug in the
settlements of primitive man, found in Périgord, ever brought to light
any imitation of the human form? Nothing could exceed the interest
of such a discovery. Research has not been entirely fruitless in this
respect, and it is hoped that the first attempt in the art of statuary of
this primitive people may yet be discovered. In the cave of Laugerie-Basse,
M. de Vibraye found a little ivory statuette, which he takes to
be a kind of idol of an indecent character. The head and legs, as well
as the arms, are broken off.</p>

<p>Another human figure (fig. 72), which, like the preceding one,
is long and lean, is graven on a staff of authority, a fragment of
which was found in the cave of La Madelaine by MM. Lartet and
Christy. The man is represented standing between two horses' heads,
and by the side of a long serpent or fish, having the appearance of an
eel. On the reverse side of the same bâton, which is not given in the
figure, the heads of two bisons are represented.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 72.&mdash;Staff of Authority, on which are

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">On a fragment of a spear-head, found in the same settlement of
Laugerie-Basse, there is a series of human hands, provided with four
fingers only, represented in demi-relief. M. Lartet has called attention
to the fact, that certain savage tribes still depict the hand without
noticing the thumb.</p>

<p>In fig. 39, which represents man during the reindeer epoch, such
as we must suppose him to have been from the sum total of our
present stock of information on the point, we see a man clothed in
garments sewn with a needle, carrying as his chief weapon the jaw-bone
of a bear armed with its sharp fang, and also provided with his
flint hatchet or knife. Close to him a woman is seated, arrayed in
all the personal ornaments which are known to have been peculiar to
this epoch.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"> [Pg 112]</a></span></p>
<p>The question now arises, what were the characteristics of man
during the reindeer epoch, with regard to his physical organisation?</p>

<p>We know a little of some of the broader features of his physiognomy
from studying the objects found in the Belgian bone-caves, of which
we have spoken in the introduction to this work. These caves were
explored by M. Édouard Dupont, assisted by M. Van Beneden, a
Belgian palæontologist and anatomist. The excavations in question
were ordered by King Leopold's Government, which supplied the funds
necessary for extending them as far as possible. The three caves, all
situated in the valley of the Lesse, are the <i>Trou des Nutons</i>, the <i>Trou
du Frontal</i>, at Furfooz, near Dinant, and the <i>Caverne de Chaleux</i>, in
the neighbourhood of the town from which its name is derived.</p>

<p>The <i>Trou des Nutons</i> and the <i>Trou du Frontal</i> have been completely
thrown into confusion by a violent inroad of water; for the
<i>débris</i> that they contained were intermingled in an almost incredible
confusion with a quantity of earthy matter and calcareous rocks, which
had been drifted in by the inundation.</p>

<p>In the <i>Trou des Nutons</i>, which is situated about 164 feet above
the level of the Lesse, M. Van Beneden recognised a great many
bones of the reindeer, the urus, and many other species which are
not yet extinct. These bones were indiscriminately mixed up with
bones and horns of the reindeer carved into different shapes, knuckle-bones
of the goat polished on both sides, a whistle made from the
tibia of a goat, from which sounds could still be produced, fragments of
very coarse pottery, some remains of fire-hearths, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The <i>Trou du Frontal</i> was thus named by M. Édouard Dupont,
from the fact of a human frontal-bone having been found there on the
day that the excavations commenced. This was not the only discovery
of the kind that was to be made. Ere long they fell in with a great
quantity of human bones, intermixed with a considerable number of
the bones of reindeer and other animals, as well as implements of all
kinds. M. Van Beneden ascertained that the bones must have belonged
to thirteen persons of various ages; some of them are the
bones of infants scarcely a year old. Among them were found two
perfect skulls which are in good preservation; these remains are also
very valuable, because they afford data from which deductions may be
drawn as to the cranial conformation of the primitive inhabitants of
the banks of the Lesse.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"> [Pg 113]</a></span></p>
<p>M. Édouard Dupont is of opinion that this cave was used as a burial-place.
It is, in fact, very probable that such was the purpose for
which it was intended; for a large flag-stone was found in it, which
was probably used to close up the mouth of the cave, and to shield the
dead bodies from profanation. If this be the case, the animal bones
which were scattered around are the remains of the funeral banquets
which it was the custom to provide during the epoch of the great bear
and the mammoth.</p>

<p>It is interesting to establish the existence of such a similarity between
the customs of men who were separated by vast tracts of land
and an interval of many thousands of years.</p>

<p>Immediately above the <i>Trou du Frontal</i> there is a cave called <i>Trou
Rosette</i>, in which the bones of three persons of various ages were
found intermingled with the bones of reindeer and beavers; fragments
of a blackish kind of pottery were also found there, which were
hollowed out in rough grooves by way of ornamentation, and merely
hardened in the fire. M. Dupont is of opinion that the three men
whose remains were discovered were crushed to death by masses of
rock at the time of the great inundation, traces of which may still be
seen in the valley of the Lesse.</p>

<p>By the falling in of its roof, which buried under a mass of rubbish
all the objects which were contained in it at the time of the catastrophe
and thus kept them in their places, the cave of Chaleux escaped the
complete disturbance with which the above-mentioned caverns were
visited. The bones of mammals, of birds, and of fish were found there;
also some carved bones and horns of the reindeer, some fossil shells,
which, as we have before observed, came from Champagne, and were
used as ornaments; lastly, and chiefly, wrought flints numbering
at least 30,000. In the hearth, which was placed in the
middle of the cave, a stone was discovered with certain signs on it,
which, up to the present time, have remained unexplained. M. Dupont,
as we have previously stated, collected in the immediate vicinity about
twenty-two pounds' weight of the bones of the water-rat either scorched
or roasted; this proves that when a more noble and substantial food
failed them, the primitive inhabitants of this country were able to
content themselves with these small and unsavoury rodents.</p>

<p>The two skulls which were found at Furfooz have been carefully
examined by MM. Van Beneden and Pruner-Bey, who are both great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"> [Pg 114]</a></span>
authorities on the subject of anthropology. These skulls present considerable
discrepancies, but Pruner-Bey is of opinion that they are
heads of a male and female of the same race. In order to
justify his hypothesis the learned anthropologist says, that there is
often more difference between the skulls of the two sexes of the same
race, than between the skulls of the same sex belonging to two distinct
races.</p>

<div class="figcenter topspace2"><a name="i_155.jpg" id="i_155.jpg"></a>
<img src="images/i_155.jpg"
alt="Skull found at Furfooz"  />
<div class="caption">Fig. 73.&mdash;Skull found at Furfooz,
by M. Édouard Dupont.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">One of these skulls is distinguished by a projecting jaw; the other,
which is represented in fig. 73, has jaws even with the facial outline.
The prominent jaw of the first, which is the indication of a degraded
race (like that of the negro), does not prevent its having a
higher forehead and a more capacious cranium than the other skull.
We find here an actual intermingling of the characteristics which
belong to the inferior races with those peculiar to the Caucasian race,
which is considered to be the most exalted type of the human species.</p>

<p>According to Pruner-Bey, the Belgian people during the reindeer
epoch were a race of small stature but very sturdy; the face was
lozenge-shaped, and the whole skull had the appearance of a pyramid.
This race of a Turanian or Mongolian origin was the same as the
Ligurian or Iberian race, which still exists in the north of Italy (Gulf
of Genoa), and in the Pyrenees (Basque districts).</p>

<p>These conclusions must be accepted with the highest degree of
caution, for they do not agree with the opinions of all anthropologists.
M. Broca is of opinion that the Basques have sprung from a North
African race, which spread over Europe at a time when an isthmus
existed where the Straits of Gibraltar are now situated. This idea is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"> [Pg 115]</a></span>
only reasonable; for certain facts prove that Europe and Africa were
formerly connected by a neck of land; this was afterwards submerged,
at the spot where the Straits of Gibraltar now exist,
bringing about the disjunction of Europe and Africa. It will be sufficient
proof, if we point to the analogy subsisting between the <i>fauna</i>
of the two countries, which is established by the existence of a number
of wild monkeys which, even in the present day, inhabit this arid rock,
and are also to be met with on the opposite African shore.</p>

alt="Old man skull"  />
<div class="caption">Fig. 74.&mdash;Skull of an old Man, found
in a <i>Rock-shelter</i> at Bruniquel.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">In the interesting excavations which were made in the <i>rock-shelters</i>
at Bruniquel, M. V. Brun found a quantity of human bones, and
particularly two skulls&mdash;one that of an old man, the other that of an
adult. We here (fig. 74) give a representation of the old man's
skull taken from a photograph which M. V. Brun has been kind
enough to send us.</p>

<p>If we measure the facial angle of this skull, we shall find that it
does not differ from the skulls of the men who at the present time
inhabit the same climates. From this fact, it may be gathered how
mistaken the idea may be which looks upon primitive man, or the man
of the stone epoch as a being essentially different from the men of the
present day. The phrase <i>fossil man</i>, we must again repeat, should
be expunged from the vocabulary of science; we should thus harmonise
better with established facts, and should also do away with a misunderstanding
which is highly detrimental to the investigations into
the origin of man.</p>

<p>In concluding this account of the manners and customs of man
during the reindeer epoch, we must say a few words as to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"> [Pg 116]</a></span>
funeral rites of this time, or rather, the mode of burial peculiar to
this period of primitive man's history.</p>

<p>Those who lived in caves buried their dead in caves. It is, also, a
fact to be remarked, that man often uses the same type for both his
burial-places and dwelling-places.</p>

<p>The burial-places of the Tartars of Kasan, says M. Nilsson, are
exact likenesses, on a small scale, of their dwelling-places, and like
them, are constructed of beams placed close to one another. A
Circassian burial-place is perfectly similar to a Circassian dwelling.
The tombs of the Karaite Jews, in the valley of Jehoshaphat, resemble
their houses and places of worship, and the Neo-Grecian tombs, in the
Crimea, are likewise imitations of their churches.<a name="fnanchor_10"
id="fnanchor_10"></a><a href="#footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>We shall not, therefore, be surprised to learn that man during the
reindeer epoch buried his dead in caves, just in the same way as was
done by his ancestors during the epoch of the great bear and the
mammoth, that is to say, the dead were interred in the same kind of
caves as those which were then generally used as places of abode.</p>

<p>Fig. 75 represents a funeral ceremonial during the reindeer epoch.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 75.&mdash;A Funeral Ceremony during

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">The corpse is borne on a litter of boughs, a practice which is still in
use among some modern savages. Men provided with torches, that is
branches of resinous trees, preceded the funeral procession, in order to
light the interior of the cavern. The cave is open, ready to receive
the corpse, and it will be closed again after it is deposited there.
The weapons, ornaments, and utensils which he had prized during his
lifetime, are brought in to be laid by the side of the dead.</p>

<p>We will sum up the principal facts which we have laid before our
readers in this account of the condition of mankind during the reindeer
epoch, by quoting an eloquent passage from a report addressed
by M. Édouard Dupont to the Belgian Minister of the Interior, on
the excavations carried on by this eminent Belgian geologist in the
caves in the neighbourhood of Furfooz.</p>

<p>"The data obtained from the fossils of Chaleux, together with those
which have been met with in the caves of Furfooz, present us," says
M. Dupont, "with a striking picture of the primitive ages of mankind
in Belgium.</p>

<p>"These ancient tribes and all their customs, after having been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"> [Pg 117]</a></span>
buried in oblivion for thousands and thousands of years, are again
vividly brought before our eyes; and, like the wondrous bird, which,
in its ashes, found a new source of life, antiquity lives again in the
relics of its former existence.</p>

<p>"We may almost fancy that we can see them in their dark and
subterranean retreats, crouching round their hearths, and skilfully and
patiently chipping out their flint instruments and shaping their reindeer-horn
tools, in the midst of all the pestilential emanations arising
from the various animal remains which their carelessness has allowed
to remain in their dwellings. Skins of wild beasts are stripped of their
hair, and, by the aid of flint needles, are converted into garments.
In our mind's eye, we may see them engaged in the chase, and hunting
wild animals&mdash;their only weapons being darts and spears, the fatal
points of which are formed of nothing but a splinter of flint.</p>

<p>"Again, we are present at their feasts, in which, during the period
when their hunting has been fortunate, a horse, a bear, or a reindeer
becomes the more noble substitute for the tainted flesh of the rat, their
sole resource in the time of famine.</p>

<p>"Now, we see them trafficking with the tribes inhabiting the
region now called France, and procuring the jet and fossil shells with
which they love to adorn themselves, and the flint which is to them
so precious a material. On one side they are picking up the fluor spar,
the colour of which is pleasing to their eyes; on the other, they are
digging out the great slabs of sandstone which are to be placed as
hearthstones round their fire.</p>

<p>"But, alas! inauspicious days arrive, and certainly misfortune does
not seem to spare them. A falling in of the roof of their cave drives
them out of their chief dwelling-place. The objects of their worship,
their weapons, and their utensils&mdash;all are buried there, and they are
forced to fly and take up their abode in another spot.</p>

<p>"The ravages of death break in upon them; how great are the cares
which are now lavished upon those whom they have lost! They bear
the corpse into its cavernous sepulchre; some weapons, an amulet, and
perhaps an urn, form the whole of the funeral furniture. A slab of
stone prevents the inroad of wild beasts. Then begins the funeral
banquet, celebrated close by the abode of the dead; a fire is lighted,
great animals are cut up, and portions of their smoking flesh are distributed
to each. How strange the ceremonies that must then have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"> [Pg 118]</a></span>
taken place! ceremonies like those told us of the savages of the Indian
and African solitudes. Imagination may easily depict the songs, the
dances and the invocations, but science is powerless to call them into
life.</p>

<p>"The sepulchre is often reopened; little children and adults came
in turn to take their places in the gloomy cave. Thirteen times the
same ceremonial occurs, and thirteen times the slab is moved to admit
the corpses.</p>

<p>"But the end of this primitive age is at last come. Torrents of
water break in upon the country. Its inhabitants, driven from their
abodes, in vain take refuge on the lofty mountain summits. Death at
last overtakes them, and a dark cavern is the tomb of the wretched
beings, who, at Furfooz, were witnesses of this immense catastrophe.</p>

<p>"Nothing is respected by the terrible element. The sepulchre, the
object of such care on the part of the artless tribe, is burst open before
the torrent, and the bones of the dead bodies, disjointed by the water,
are dispersed into the midst of the crumbling earth and stones. Their
former habitation alone is exempt from this common destruction, for
it has been protected by a previous catastrophe&mdash;the sinking in of its
roof on to the ground of the cave."</p>

<p>Having now given a sketch of the chief features presented by man
and his surroundings during the reindeer epoch; having described the
most important objects of his skill, and dwelt upon the products of his
artistic faculties; it now remains for us to complete, in a scientific point
of view, the study of this question, by notifying the sources from which
we have been able to gather our data, and to bring home to our
minds these interesting ideas. Under this head, we may state that
almost all the information which has been obtained has been derived
from caves; and it will, therefore, be best to make a few brief
remarks on the caverns which have been the scene of these various
discoveries.</p>

<p>Honour to whom honour is due. In mentioning these localities,
we must place in the first class the settlements of Périgord, which
have contributed to so great an extent towards the knowledge which
we possess of primitive man. The four principal ones are, the cave of
Les Eyzies and the rock-shelters or caverns of La Madelaine, Laugerie-Haute,
and Laugerie-Basse. All of them have been explored by
MM. Lartet and Christy, who, after having directed the excavations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"> [Pg 119]</a></span>
with the greatest ability, have set forth the results of their researches
in a manner no less remarkable.<a name="fnanchor_11"
id="fnanchor_11"></a><a href="#footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The settlement of Laugerie-Basse has also been explored by
M. de Vibraye, who collected there some very interesting specimens.</p>

<p>We have no intention of reverting to what we have before stated
when describing the objects found in these various localities. We will
content ourselves with mentioning the lumbar vertebral bone of a reindeer
found in the cave of Eyzies, of which we have given a representation
in fig. 55; it was pierced through by an arrow-head, which
may still be seen fixed in it. If any doubts could still exist of the co-existence,
in France, of man and the reindeer, this object should suffice
to put an end to them for ever.</p>

<p>We will mention, as next in importance, the cave and rock-shelters
at Bruniquel (Tarn-et-Garonne). They have been carefully examined
by a great many explorers, among whom we must specify M. Garrigou,
M. de Lastic (the proprietor of the cavern), M. V. Brun, the learned
Director of the Museum of Natural History at Montauban, and
M. Peccadeau de l'Isle.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that M. de Lastic sold about fifteen hundred
specimens of every description of the relics which had been found on
his property, to Professor Owen, for the British Museum. In this
large quantity of relics, there were, of course, specimens which will
never be met with elsewhere; which, therefore, it would have been
better in every respect to have retained in France.</p>

<p>The cave of Bruniquel has also furnished us with human bones,
amongst which are two almost perfect skulls, one of which we have
previously represented; also two half jaw-bones which resemble those
found at Moulin-Quignon. M. V. Brun has given, in his interesting
work, a representation of these human remains.<a name="fnanchor_12"
id="fnanchor_12"></a><a href="#footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>We will now mention the <i>Cave of Bize</i> near Narbonne (Aude);
the <i>Cave of La Vache</i> in the valley of Tarascon (Ariége), in which
M. Garrigou collected an immense quantity of bones, on one of which
some peculiar characters are graven, constituting, perhaps, a first
attempt in the art of writing; the <i>Cavern of Massat</i> in the same
department, which has been described by M. Fontan, and is thought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"> [Pg 120]</a></span>
by M. Lartet to have been a summer dwelling-place, the occupiers of
which lived on raw flesh and snails, for no traces of a hearth are
to be seen, although it must have been used for a considerable time as
a shelter by primitive man; the <i>Cave of Lourdes</i>, near Tarbes (Hautes-Pyrénées),
in which M. Milne-Edwards met with a fragment of a
human skull, belonging to an adult individual; the <i>Cave of Espalungue</i>,
also called the <i>Grotto of Izeste</i> (Basses-Pyrénées), where MM.
Garrigou and Martin found a human bone, the fifth left metatarsal;
the <i>Cave of Savigné</i> (Vienne), situated on the banks of the Charente,
and discovered by M. Joly-Leterme, an architect of Saumur, who there
found a fragment of a stag's bone, on which the bodies of two animals
are graven with hatchings to indicate shadows; the <i>Grottos of La
Balme and Bethenas</i>, in Dauphiné, explored by M. Chantre; lastly,
the settlement of Solutré, in the neighbourhood of Mâcon, from which
MM. Ferry and Arcelin have exhumed two human skulls, together
with some very fine flint instruments of the Laugerie-Haute type.</p>

<p>These settlements do not all belong to the same epoch, although
most of them correspond to the long period known as the reindeer
epoch. It is not always possible to determine their comparative
chronology. From the state of their <i>débris</i> it can, however, be ascertained,
that the caves of Lourdes and Espalungue date back to the
most ancient period of the reindeer epoch; whilst the settlements of
Périgord, of Tarn-et-Garonne, and of Mâconnais are of a later date.
The cave of Massat seems as if it ought to be dated at the beginning
of the wrought stone epoch, for no bones have been found there, either
of the reindeer or the horse; the remains of the bison are the sole
representatives of the extinct animal species.</p>

<p>In concluding this list of the French bone-caves which have served
to throw a light upon the peculiar features of man's existence during
the reindeer epoch, we must not omit to mention the Belgian caves,
which have been so zealously explored by M. Édouard Dupont.
From the preceding pages, we may perceive how especially important
the latter have been in the elucidation of the characteristics of man's
physical organisation during this epoch.</p>

<p>France and Belgium are not the only countries which have
furnished monuments relating to man's history during the reindeer
epoch. We must not omit to mention that settlements of this epoch
have been discovered both in Germany and also in Switzerland.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"> [Pg 121]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1866 a great quantity of bones and broken instruments were
found at the bottom of an ancient glacier-moraine in the neighbourhood
of Rabensburg, not far from the lake of Constance. The bones
of the reindeer formed about ninety-eight hundredths of these remains.
The other <i>débris</i> were the bones of the horse, the wolf, the
brown bear, the white fox, the glutton and the ox.</p>

<p>In 1858, on a mountain near Geneva, a cave was discovered about
12 feet deep and 6 feet wide, which contained, under a layer of
carbonate of lime, a great quantity of flints and bones. The bones of
the reindeer formed the great majority of them, for eighteen skeletons
of this animal were found. The residue of the remains were composed
of four horses, six ibex, intermingled with the bones of the marmot,
the chamois, and the hazel-hen; in short, the bones of the whole
animal population which, at the present time, has abandoned the
valleys of Switzerland, and is now only to be met with on the high
mountains of the Alps.</p>

<div class="chapsum">The European Deluge&mdash;The Dwelling-place of Man during the Polished-stone
Epoch&mdash;The Caves and Rock-shelters still used as Dwelling-places&mdash;Principal
Caves belonging to the Polished-stone Epoch which have been explored up to
the present Time&mdash;The Food of Man during this period.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Aided</span> by records drawn from the bowels of the earth, we have now
traversed the series of antediluvian ages since the era when man first
made his appearance on the earth, and have been enabled, though but
very imperfectly, to reconstruct the history of our primitive forefathers.
We will now leave this epoch, through the dark night of
which science seeks almost in vain to penetrate, and turn our attention
to a period the traces of which are more numerous and more
easily grasped by our intelligence&mdash;a period, therefore, which we are
able to characterise with a much greater degree of precision.</p>

<p>A great catastrophe, the tradition of which is preserved in the
memory of all nations, marked in Europe the end of the quaternary
epoch. It is not easy to assign the exact causes for this great event
in the earth's history; but whatever may be the explanation given,
it is certain that a cataclysm, caused by the violent flowing of rushing
water, took place during the quaternary geological epoch; for the
traces of it are everywhere visible. These traces consist of a reddish
clayey deposit, mixed with sand and pebbles. This deposit is called
in some countries <i>red diluvium</i>, and in others <i>grey diluvium</i>. In
the valley of the Rhone and the Rhine it is covered with a layer of
loamy deposit, which is known to geologists by the name of
<i>loess</i> or <i>lehm</i>, and as to the origin of which they are not all agreed.
Sir Charles Lyell is of opinion that this mud was produced by the
crushing of the rocks by early Alpine glaciers, and that it was
afterwards carried down by the streams of water which descended
from these mountains. This mud covers a great portion of Belgium,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"> [Pg 126]</a></span>
where it is from 10 to 30 feet in thickness, and supplies with material
a large number of brickfields.</p>

<p>This deposit, that is the <i>diluvial beds</i>, constitutes nearly the most
recent of all those which form the earth's crust; in many European
countries, it is, in fact the ground trodden under the feet of the
present population.</p>

<p>The inundation to which the <i>diluvium</i> is referred closes the series
of the quaternary ages. After this era, the present geological period
commences, which is characterised by the almost entire permanency of
the vertical outline of the earth, and by the formation of peat-bogs.</p>

<p>The earliest documents afforded us by history are very far from
going back to the starting-point of this period. The history of the
ages which we call historical is very far from having attained to the
beginning of the present geological epoch.</p>

<p>In order to continue our account of the progressive development of
primitive man, we must now turn our attention to the <i>Polished-stone
Epoch</i>, or the <i>Epoch of Tamed Animals</i>, which precedes the
Metal Age.</p>

<p>As the facts which we shall have to review are very numerous, we
will, in the first place, consider this epoch as it affects those parts of
our continent which form the present France and Belgium; next,
with reference to Denmark and Switzerland, in which countries we
shall have to point out certain manners and customs of man of an
altogether special character.</p>

<p>We shall consider in turn:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. The habitation of man during the polished-stone epoch.</p>

<p>2nd. His system of food.</p>

<p>3rd. His arts and manufactures.</p>

<p>4th. The weapons manufactured by him, and their use in war.</p>

<p>5th. His attainments in agriculture, fishing, and navigation.</p>

<p>6th. His funeral ceremonies.</p>

<p>7th. Lastly, the characteristics of mankind during this epoch.</p>


<p><i>Habitation.</i>&mdash;In that part of the European continent which now
forms the country called France, man, during that period we designate
under the name of the polished-stone epoch, continued for a
considerable time to inhabit rock-shelters and caves which afforded
him the best retreat from the attacks of wild beasts.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"> [Pg 127]</a></span></p>
<p>This fact has been specially proved to have been the case in the
extreme south of the above-mentioned country. Among the investigations
which have contributed towards its verification, we must give
particular notice to those made by MM. Garrigou and Filhol in the
caves of the Pyrenees (Ariége). These two <i>savants</i> have also explored
the caves of Pradières, Bedeilhac, Labart, Niaux, Ussat, and
Fontanel.<a name="fnanchor_13"
id="fnanchor_13"></a><a href="#footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>]</p>

<p>In one of these caves, which we have already mentioned in the
preceding chapter, but to which we must again call attention&mdash;for
they belong both to the polished stone, and also to the reindeer
epoch&mdash;MM. Garrigou and Filhol found the bones of a huge ox, the
urus or <i>Bos primigenius</i>, a smaller kind of ox, the stag, the sheep,
the goat, the antelope, the chamois, the wild boar, the wolf, the
dog, the fox, the badger, the hare, and possibly those of the horse.
Neither the bones of the reindeer nor the bison are included in this
list of names; on account of the mildness of the climate, these two
species had already migrated towards the north and east in search of
a colder atmosphere.</p>

<p>The remains of hearths, bones split lengthwise, and broken skulls,
indicate that the inhabitants of these caves lived on much the
same food as their ancestors. It is probable that they also ate
raw snails, for a large quantity of their shells were found in this
cave, and also in the cavern of Massat,<a name="fnanchor_14"
id="fnanchor_14"></a><a href="#footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
the presence of which can
only be accounted for in this way.</p>

<p>These remains were found intermingled with piercers, spear-heads,
and arrow-heads, all made of bone; also hatchets, knives, and scratchers,
made of flint, and also of various other substances, which were more
plentiful than flint in that country, such as siliceous schist, quartzite,
leptinite and serpentine stones. These instruments were carefully
wrought, and a few had been polished at one end on a slab of
flag-stone.</p>

<p>In the cave of Lourdes (Hautes-Pyrénées), which has been explored
by M. Alphonse Milne-Edwards, two layers were observed;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"> [Pg 128]</a></span>
one belonging to the reindeer epoch, and the other to the polished-stone
epoch.<a name="fnanchor_15"
id="fnanchor_15"></a><a href="#footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
The cave of Pontil (Hérault), which has been carefully
examined by Professor Gervais,<a name="fnanchor_16"
id="fnanchor_16"></a><a href="#footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
has furnished remains of every
epoch including the bronze age; we must, however, except the reindeer
epoch, which is not represented in this cave.</p>

<p>Lastly, we will mention the cave of Saint-Jean-d'Alcas (Aveyron),
which has been explored, at different times, by M. Cazalis de Fondouce.
This is a sepulchral cave, like that of Aurignac. When it
was first explored, about twenty years ago, five human skulls, in good
preservation, were found in it&mdash;a discovery, the importance of which
was then unheeded, and the skulls were, in consequence, totally lost
to science. Flint, jade, and serpentine instruments, carved bones,
remains of rough pottery, stone amulets, and the shells of shell-fish,
which had formed necklaces and bracelets, were intermingled with
human bones.</p>

<p>At Saint-Jean-d'Alcas, M. Cazalis de Fondouce did not meet with
any remains of funeral banquets such as were found at Aurignac and
Furfooz; he only noticed two large flag-stones lying across one
another at the mouth of the cave, so as to make the inlet considerably
narrower.</p>

<p>This cave, according to a recent publication of M. Cazalis, must be
referred to a more recent epoch than was at first supposed, for some
fragments of metallic substances were found in it. It must, therefore,
have belonged to a late period of the polished-stone epoch.
<a name="fnanchor_17"
id="fnanchor_17"></a><a href="#footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><i>Man's System of Feeding during the Polished-stone Epoch.</i>&mdash;In
order to obtain full information on the subject of man's food in the
north and centre of Europe during the polished-stone epoch, we
must appeal to the interesting researches of which Denmark has been
the scene during the last few years; but these researches, on account
of their importance, require a detailed account.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> classed in the lowest rank on account of the small extent
of its territory and the number of its inhabitants, the Danish nation
is, nevertheless, one of the most important in Europe, in virtue of
the eminence to which it has attained in science and arts. This
valiant, although numerically speaking, inconsiderable people, can
boast of a great number of distinguished men who are an honour to
science. The unwearied researches of their archæologists and antiquarians
have ransacked the dust of bygone ages, in order to call
into new life the features of a vanished world. Their labours, guided
by the observations of naturalists, have brought out into the clear
light of day some of the earliest stages in man's existence and
progress.</p>

<p>There is no part of the world more adapted than Denmark to this
kind of investigation. Antiquities may be met with at every step;
the real point in question is to know how to examine them properly,
so as to obtain from them important revelations concerning the
manners, customs, and manufactures of the pre-historic inhabitants.
The Museum of Copenhagen, which contains antiquities from various
Scandinavian states, is, in this respect, without a rival in the world.</p>

<p>Among the objects arranged in this well-stocked Museum a great
many specimens may be observed which have come from the so-called
<i>kitchen-middens</i>.</p>

<p>In the first place, what are these <i>kjoekken-moeddings</i>, or kitchen-middens,
with their uncouth Scandinavian name?</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"> [Pg 130]</a></span></p>
<p>Immense accumulations of shells have been observed on different
points of the Danish coast, chiefly in the north, where the sea enters
those narrow deep creeks, known by the name of <i>fiords</i>. These
deposits are not generally raised more than about 3 feet above the
level of the sea; but in some steep places their altitude is greater.
They are about 3 to 10 feet in thickness, and from 100 to 200 feet
in width; their length is sometimes as much as 1000 feet, with a
width of from 150 to 250 feet. On some of the more level shores
they form perfect hills, on which, as at Havelse, windmills are sometimes
built.</p>

<p>What do we meet with in these heaps? An immense quantity of sea-shells,
especially those of the oyster, broken bones of mammiferous
animals, remains of birds and fish; and, lastly, some roughly-wrought
flints.</p>

<p>The first idea formed with regard to these kitchen-middens was
that they were nothing but banks of fossil shells, beds which had
formerly been submerged, and subsequently brought to light by an
upheaval of the earth caused by some volcanic cause. But M. Steenstrup,
a Danish <i>savant</i>, opposed this opinion, basing his contradiction
on the fact that these shells belong to four different species which are
never found together, and consequently they must have been brought
together by man. M. Steenstrup also called attention to the fact that
almost all these shells must have belonged to full-grown animals, and
that there were hardly any young ones to be found amongst them.
A peculiarity of this kind is an evident indication of the exercise of
some rational purpose, in fact, of an act of the human will.</p>

<p>When all the <i>débris</i> and relics which we have enumerated were
discovered in these kitchen-middens, when the remains of hearths&mdash;small
spots which still retained traces of fire&mdash;were found in them,
the origin of these heaps were readily conjectured. Tribes once
existed there who subsisted on the products of fishing and hunting,
and threw out round their cabins the remains of their meals, consisting
especially of the <i>débris</i> of shell-fish. These remains gradually
accumulated, and constituted the considerable heaps which we are
discussing; hence the name of <i>kjoekken-moedding</i>, composed of two
words&mdash;<i>kjoekken</i>, kitchen; and <i>moedding</i>, heap of refuse. These
"kitchen-middens," as they are called, are, therefore, the refuse from
the meals of the primitive population of Denmark.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"> [Pg 131]</a></span></p>
<p>If we consider the heaps of oyster-shells and other <i>débris</i> which
accumulate in the neighbourhood of eating-houses in certain districts,
we may readily understand, comparing great things with small, how
these Danish kitchen-middens were produced. I myself well recollect
having noticed in the environs of Montpellier small hillocks of a
similar character, formed by the accumulation of oyster-shells, mussels,
and clams.</p>

<p>When the conviction was once arrived at that these kitchen-middens
were the refuse of the meals of the primitive inhabitants, the careful
excavation of all these heaps scattered along the Danish coast became
an extremely interesting operation. It might be justly expected that
some data would be collected as to the customs and manufactures of
the ancient dwellers in these countries. A commission was, in consequence,
appointed by the Danish Government to examine these
deposits, and to publish the results of its labours.</p>

<p>This commission was composed of three <i>savants</i>, each of whom were
eminent in their respective line&mdash;Steenstrup, the naturalist, Forchhammer,
a geologist, and the archæologist, Worsaae&mdash;and performed
its task with as much talent as zeal. The observations which were
made are recorded in three reports presented to the Academy of
Sciences at Copenhagen. From these documents are borrowed most
of the details which follow.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to acquaint our readers with the facts brought to
light by the Danish commission, it will be well to remark that Denmark
does not stand alone in possessing these kitchen-middens. They
have been discovered in England&mdash;in Cornwall and Devonshire&mdash;in
Scotland, and even in France, near Hyères (Bouches-du-Rhône).<a name="fnanchor_18"
id="fnanchor_18"></a><a href="#footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>MM. Sauvage and Hamy have pointed out to M. de Mortillet the
existence of deposits of this kind in the Pas-de-Calais. They may be
noticed, say these naturalists, at La Salle (Commune of Outreau) at
certain parts of the coast of Portel, and especially a very large heap
at Cronquelets (Commune of Etaples.) They chiefly consist of the
<i>cardium edule</i>, which appear to abound in the kitchen-middens of the
Pas-de-Calais.</p>

<p>Messrs. Evans, Prestwich, and Lubbock observed one of these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"> [Pg 132]</a></span>
deposits at Saint-Valery, near the mouth of the Somme. Added to
this, they have been described by various travellers as existing in
different parts of the world. Dampier studied them in Australia, and
Darwin in Tierra del Fuego, where deposits of the same character
are now in the course of formation. M. Pereira da Costa found one
on the coast of Portugal; Sir C. Lyell has testified to the existence
of others on the coasts of Massachusetts and Georgia, in the United
States; M. Strobel, on the coasts of Brazil. But those in Denmark
are the only deposits of this kind which have been the subject of investigations
of a deliberate and serious character.</p>

<p>Almost all these kitchen-middens are found on the coast, along the
<i>fiords</i>, where the action of the waves is not much felt. Some have,
however, been found several miles inland; but this must be owing to
the fact that the sea once occupied these localities, from which it has
subsequently retired. They are not to be met with on some of the
Danish coasts, as those of the western side; this, on the one hand,
may be caused by their having been washed away by the sea, which
has there encroached on the land, or, on the other hand, by the fact
that the western coast was much less sheltered than the other parts of
the Danish peninsula. They are not unfrequently to be found in
the adjacent islands.</p>

<p>These kitchen-middens form, in a general way, undulating mounds,
which sink in a gentle incline from the centre to the circumference.
The spot where they are thickest indicates the site of the habitations
of man. Sometimes, we may notice one principal hillock, surrounded
by smaller mounds; or else, in the middle of the heaps, there is a spot
which must have been the site of the encampment.</p>

<p>These refuse deposits are almost entirely made up of shells of
various kinds of molluscs; the principal species are the oyster, the
cockle, the mussel, and the periwinkle. Others, such as whelks,
<i>helices</i> (edible snails), <i>nassa</i>, and <i>trigonella</i>, are also found; but they
are comparatively few in number.</p>

<p>Fishes' bones are discovered in great abundance in the kitchen-middens.
They belong to the cod, herring, dab, and eel. From
this we may infer that the primitive inhabitants of Denmark were
not afraid of venturing out to brave the waves of the sea in their frail
skiffs; for the herring and the cod cannot, in fact, be caught except at
some little distance from the shore.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"> [Pg 133]</a></span></p>
<p>Mammalian bones are also plentifully distributed in the Danish
kitchen-middens. Those most commonly met with are the remains
of the stag, the roe, and the boar, which, according to M. Steenstrup's
statement, make up ninety-seven hundredths of the whole mass.
Others are the relics of the urus, the wolf, the dog, the fox, the wild-cat,
the lynx, the marten, the otter, the porpoise, the seal, the
water-rat, the beaver and the hedgehog.</p>

<p>The bison, the reindeer, the elk, the horse, and the domestic ox
have not left behind them any trace which will permit us to assume that
they existed in Denmark at the period when these deposits were formed.</p>

<p>Amongst other animals, we have mentioned the dog. By various
indications, we are led to the belief that this intelligent creature had
been at this time reduced to a state of domesticity. It has been
remarked that a large number of the bones dispersed in these kitchen-middens
are incomplete; exactly the same parts are almost always
missing, and certain bones are entirely wanting. M. Steenstrup is
of opinion that these deficiencies may be owing to the agency of dogs,
which have made it their business to ransack the heaps of bones and
other matters which were thrown aside by their masters. This
hypothesis was confirmed, in his idea, when he became convinced, by
experience, that the bones which were deficient in these deposits
were precisely those which dogs are in the habit of devouring,
and that the remaining portions of those which were found were not
likely to have been subject to their attacks on account of their
hardness and the small quantity of assimilable matter which was on
or in them.</p>

<p>Although primitive man may have elevated the dog to the dignity
of being his companion and friend, he was, nevertheless, sometimes
in the habit of eating him. No doubt he did not fall back upon this
last resort except in cases when all other means of subsistence failed
him. Bones of the dog, broken by the hand of man, and still bearing
the marks of having been cut with a knife, are amongst the remains
found, and place the fact beyond any question.</p>

<p>We find, besides, the same taste existing here which we have seen
manifested in other ages and different countries. All the long bones
have been split in order to extract their marrow&mdash;the dainty so
highly appreciated by man during the epochs of the reindeer and
the mammoth.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"> [Pg 134]</a></span></p>
<p>Some remains of birds have been found in the kitchen-middens;
but most of the species are aquatic&mdash;a fact which may be readily
explained by the seaboard position of the men who formed these
deposits.</p>

<p>As the result of this review of the various substances which were
made use of for food by the men of the polished-stone epoch, we may
infer that they were both hunters and fishermen.</p>

<p>Animals of rapid pace were hunted down by means of the dart
or arrow, and any more formidable prey was struck down at close
quarters by some sharp stone weapon.</p>

<p>Fishing was practised, as at the present day, by means of the line
and net.</p>

<p>We have already seen that men, during the reindeer epoch, probably
used hooks fastened at the end of lines. These hooks, as we have
before remarked, were made with splinters of bone or reindeer
horn. During the polished-stone epoch this fishing instrument was
much improved, and they now possessed the real hook with a
recurvate and pointed end. This kind of hook was found by Dr.
Uhlmann in one of the most ancient lacustrine stations of Switzerland.
But a curved hook was both difficult to make and also not
very durable; instead of it was used another and more simple sort&mdash;the
straight skewer fixed to serve as a hook. This is a simple
fragment of bone, about an inch long, very slender and pointed at the
two ends (fig. 77). Sometimes it is a little flattened in the middle,
or bored with a hole, into which the line was fastened.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"> [Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 77.&mdash;Bone Skewers used as Fish-hooks.
</div>
</div>
<p class="topspace2">This little splinter of bone, when hidden by the bait and fastened
to a line, was swallowed by the fish and could not be disgorged, one
of the pointed ends being certain to bury itself in the entrails of
the creature.</p>

<p>Some of our readers will perhaps be surprised to learn that men of
the polished-stone epoch were in the habit of fishing with nets; but
it is a fact that cannot be called into question, for the very conclusive
reason, that the remains of these nets have been found.</p>

<p>How could it possibly come to pass that fishing-nets of the polished-stone
epoch should have been preserved to so late a period as our
times? This is exactly the question we are about to answer.</p>

<p>On the lakes of Switzerland and of other countries, there used to
exist certain habitations of man. These are the so-called <i>lacustrine
dwellings</i> which we shall have hereafter to consider in some considerable
detail, when we come to the Bronze Age. The men who
lived on these lakes were necessarily fishers; and some traces of their
fishing-nets have been discovered by a circumstance which chemistry
finds no difficulty in explaining. Some of these lake-dwellings were
destroyed by fire; as, for instance, the lacustrine settlements of
Robenhausen and Wangen in Switzerland. The outsides of these
cabins, which were almost entirely constructed of wood, burnt, of
course, very readily; but the objects inside, chiefly consisting of
nets&mdash;the sole wealth of these tribes&mdash;could not burn freely for want
of oxygen, but were only charred with the heat. They became
covered with a slight coating of some empyreumatic or tarry matter&mdash;an
excellent medium for insuring the preservation of any organic
substance. These nets having been scorched by the fire, fell into
the water with the <i>débris</i> of the hut, and, in consequence of their
precipitate fall, never having come in actual contact with the flame,
have been preserved almost intact at the bottom of the lakes. When,
after a long lapse of centuries, they have been again recovered, these
<i>débris</i> have been the means of affording information as to the
manufacture both of the fishing-nets, and also as to the basket-work,
vegetable provisions, &amp;c., of these remote ages.</p>

<p>In one of Dr. Keller's papers on these <i>lacustrine dwellings</i>, of
which we shall have more to say further on, we find a description and
delineation of certain fishing-nets which were recovered from the
lake of Robenhausen. In the Museum of Saint-Germain we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"> [Pg 136]</a></span>
inspected with curiosity several specimens of these very nets, and
we here give a representation of one of them. There were nets
with wide meshes like that shown in fig. 78, and also some more
closely netted. The mesh is a square one, and appears to have been
made on a frame by knotting the string at each point of intersection.
All these nets are made of flax, for hemp had not yet been
cultivated.</p>

alt="Fishing net"  />
<div class="caption">Fig. 78.&mdash;Fishing-net with wide Meshes.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">These nets were held suspended in the water by means of floats,
made, not of cork, but of the thick bark of the pine-tree, and were
held down to the bottom of the water by stone weights. We give
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"> [Pg 137]</a></span>
a representation here (fig. 79), of one of these stone weights taken
from a specimen exhibited in the Museum of Saint-Germain.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 79.&mdash;Stone Weight used for sinking the
Fishing-nets.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">These stone weights, large quantities of which are to be seen in
museums, and especially in that of Saint-Germain, are, in almost every
case, nothing but pebbles bored through the centre. Sometimes,
however, they were round pieces of soft stone, having a hole made in
the middle. Through this hole the cord was passed and fastened by
a knot on the other side. By means of the floats and weights
the nets were made to assume any position in the water which was
wished.</p>

<p>The large size of the meshes in the nets belonging to the polished-stone
epoch proves, that in the lakes and rivers of this period
the fish that were used for food were of considerable dimensions.
Added to this, however, the monstrous hooks belonging to this
epoch which have been found in the Seine tend to corroborate this
hypothesis.</p>

<p>Thus, then, the art of fishing had arrived in the polished-stone
epoch to a very advanced stage of improvement.</p>

<p>In plate 80 we give a representation of fishing as carried on during
the polished-stone epoch.</p>

<p class="topspace2">Returning to the subject of the ancient Danes, we must add, that
these men, who lived on the sea-coasts, clad themselves in skins of
beasts, rendered supple by the fat of the seal and marrow extracted
from the bones of some of the large mammals. For dwelling-places
they used tents likewise made of skins prepared in the same
way.</p>


<p><i>Arts and Manufactures.</i>&mdash;What degree of skill in this respect was
attained by the men who lived during the polished-stone epoch? To
give an answer to this question, we must again ransack those same
kitchen-middens which have been the means of furnishing us with
such accurate information as to the system of food of the man of that
period. We shall also have to turn our attention to the remains found
in the principal caves of this epoch.</p>

<p>An examination of the instruments found in the kitchen-middens
shows us that the flints are in general of a very imperfect type, with
the exception, however, of the long splinters or knives, the workmanship
of which indicates a considerable amount of skill.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"> [Pg 138]</a></span></p>
<p>Fig. 81 represents a flint knife from one of the Danish deposits,
delineated in the Museum of Saint-Germain; and fig. 82 a <i>nucleus</i>,
that is, a piece of flint from which splinters have been taken off, which
were intended to be used as knives.</p>

<p class="topspace2">Besides these instruments, bodkins, spear-heads, and stones for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"> [Pg 139]</a></span>
slings have also been found in the kitchen-middens, without taking
into account a quantity of fragments of flint which do not appear to
have been wrought with any special purpose in view, and were
probably nothing but rough attempts, or the mere refuse of the
manufacture.</p>

<p class="topspace2">In the same deposits there are also found a good many pebbles,
which, according to the general opinion, must have been used as
weights to sink the fishing-nets to the bottom of the water. Some are
hollowed out with a groove all round them, like that depicted in
fig. 86, which is designed from a specimen in the Museum of
Saint-Germain. Others have a hole bored through the middle. This
groove or hole was, doubtless, intended to hold the cord which fastened
the stone weight to the net.</p>

</div>

<p class="topspace2"><i>Weapons and Tools.</i>&mdash;We shall now pass on to the weapons and
tools which were in use among the people in the north of Europe
during the period we are considering.</p>

<p>During the latter period of the polished-stone epoch working in
stone attained to a really surprising degree of perfection among the
people of the North. It is, in fact, difficult to understand how, without
making use of any metallic tools, men could possibly impart to
flint, when fashioned into weapons and implements of all kinds, those
regular and elegant shapes which the numerous excavations that have
been set on foot are constantly bringing to light. The Danish flint
may, it is true, be wrought with great facility; but nevertheless, an
extraordinary amount of skill would be none the less necessary in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"> [Pg 140]</a></span>
order to produce that rectitude of outline and richness of contour
which are presented by the Danish specimens of this epoch&mdash;specimens
which will not be surpassed even in the Bronze Age.</p>

<p>The hatchets found in the north of Europe, belonging to the
polished-stone epoch, differ very considerably from the hatchets of
France and Belgium. The latter are rounded and bulging at the edges;
but the hatchets made use of by the people of the North (fig. 87)
were flatter and cut squarely at the edge. They were nearly in the
shape of a rectangle or elongated trapezium, with the four angles cut
off. Their dimensions are sometimes considerable; some have been
found which measured nearly 16 inches in length.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">Independently of this type, which is the most plentiful, the northern
tribes used also to manufacture the drilled hatchet, which is combined
in various ways with the hammer. In these instruments, the
best workmanship and the most pleasing shapes are to be noticed.
The figs. 88, 89 and 90, designed in the Museum of Saint-Germain,
from authentic specimens sent by the Museum of Copenhagen,
represent double-edged axes and axe-hammers. They are all
pierced with a round hole in which the handle was fixed. The cutting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"> [Pg 141]</a></span>
edge describes an arc of a circle, and the other end is wrought into
sharp angular edges.</p>

</div>

<p class="topspace2">These hatchets are distinguished from those of the reindeer epoch
by a characteristic which enables us to refer them without hesitation
to their real date, even in cases in which they have not yet been
subject to the operation of polishing. The hatchets of the reindeer
epoch have their cutting edge at the narrowest end, whilst those of
the polished-stone epoch are sharp at their widest end. This observation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"> [Pg 142]</a></span>
does not apply specially to the Danish hatchets; it refers equally to
those of other European countries.</p>

<p>The spear-heads are masterpieces of good taste, patience, and skill.
There are two sorts of them. The most beautiful (figs. 91, 92)
assume the shape of a laurel-leaf; they are quite flat, and chipped all
over with an infinite amount of art. Their length is as much as
15 inches. Others are shorter and thicker in shape, and terminate
at the base in an almost cylindrical handle. Sometimes they are
toothed at the edge (fig. 93). These spear-heads were evidently fixed
at the end of a staff, like the halberds of the middle ages and the
modern lance.</p>

<p class="topspace2">The poniards (fig. 94) are no less admirable in their workmanship
than the spear-heads, from which they do not perceptibly differ,
except in having a handle, which is flat, wide, solid, and made a
little thicker at the end. This handle is always more or less ornamented,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"> [Pg 143]</a></span>
and is sometimes covered with delicate carving. To chip
a flint in this way must have required a skilful and well-practised
hand.</p>

<p class="topspace2">After these somewhat extraordinary instruments, we must mention
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"> [Pg 144]</a></span>
the arrow-heads, the shapes of which are rather varied in their
character.</p>

<p>The arrow-heads most frequently found are formed in the shape of
a triangular prism, terminating at the lower end in a stem intended to
be inserted into a stick (fig. 95); others are deeply indented at the
base and quite flat. Many are finely serrated on the edges, and occasionally
even on the inside edge of the indentation.</p>

<p>Figs. 95, 96, 97, and 98 represent the various types of Danish
arrow-heads, all of which are in the Museum of Saint-Germain, and
from which these designs were made.</p>

<p class="topspace2">The chisels and gouges equally merit a special mention.</p>

<p>The chisel (fig. 99) is a kind of quadrangular prism, chipped in a
bevel down to the base.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">The gouges are hollowed out on one of their faces, so as to act as the
tool the name of which has been applied to them.</p>

<p>We next come to some curious instruments, of which we have given
designs taken from the specimens in the Museum of Saint-Germain;
the purpose they were applied to is still problematical. They are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"> [Pg 145]</a></span>
small flakes, or blades, in the shape of a crescent (figs. 100, 101).
The inner edge, which was either straight or concave, is usually serrated
like a saw; the convex side must have been fixed into a handle; for
the traces of the handle may still be detected upon many of them.
These instruments were probably made use of as scrapers in the
preparation of skins for garments; perhaps, also, they were used as
knives or as saws.</p>

<p class="topspace2">We must now turn our attention to instruments made of bone or
stag's horn. They are much less numerous than those of stone, and
have nothing about them of a very remarkable character. The only
implement that is worthy of notice is the harpoon (fig. 102). It is a
carved bone, and furnished with teeth all along one side, the other
edge being completely smooth. The harpoon of the reindeer epoch was
decidedly superior to it.</p>

<p class="topspace2">On account of its singularity, we must not omit to mention an
object made of bone, composed of a wide flat plate, from which spring
seven or eight teeth of considerable length, and placed very close
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"> [Pg 146]</a></span>
together; there is a kind of handle, much narrower, and terminating
in a knob, like the top of a walking-stick. This is probably one of the
first combs which ever unravelled the thickly-grown heads of hair of
primitive man.</p>

<p class="topspace2">It is a well-known fact that amber is very plentiful on the coasts of
the Baltic. Even in the Stone Age, it was already much appreciated
by the northern tribes, who used to make necklaces of it, either by
merely perforating the rough morsels of amber and stringing them in
a row, or by cutting them into spherical or elliptical beads, as is the
case nowadays.</p>

<p>Fig. 104 represents a necklace and also various other ornaments
made of yellow amber, which have been drawn from specimens in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"> [Pg 147]</a></span>

<p class="topspace2">Although these northern tribes of the polished-stone epoch were
such skilful workmen in flint, they were, nevertheless, but poor hands
at pottery. The <i>débris</i> of vessels collected from the Danish <i>kitchen-middens</i>,
and also from the peat-bogs and tombs, are in every way
rough, and testify to a very imperfect knowledge of the art of moulding
clay. They may be said to mark the first efforts of a manufacturing
art which is just springing into existence, which is seeking for the
right path, although not, as yet, able to find it. The art of pottery
(if certain relics be relied on) was more advanced at a more ancient
period, that is, during the reindeer epoch.</p>

<p>We have already stated that during the reindeer epoch there
existed certain manufactories of weapons and tools, the productions of
which were distributed all round the adjacent districts, although over
a somewhat restricted circle. In the epoch at which we have now
arrived, certain <i>workshops</i>&mdash;for really this is the proper name to give
them&mdash;acquired a remarkable importance, and their relations became
of a much more extensive character. In several of the Belgian caves,
flints have been found which must have come from the celebrated workshop
of Grand-Pressigny, situated in that part of the present France
which forms the department of Indre-et-Loire, and, from their very
peculiar character, are easily recognisable. Commerce and manufacture
had then emerged from their merely rudimentary state, and were entering
into a period of activity implying a certain amount of civilisation.</p>

<p>The great principle of division of labour had already been put into
practice, for there were special workshops both for the shaping and
polishing of flints.</p>

<p>The most important of all the workshops which have been noticed
in France is, unquestionably, that of Grand-Pressigny, which we
have already mentioned. It was discovered by Dr. Léveillé, the
medical man of the place; but, to tell the truth, it is not so much in
itself a centre of manufacture as a series of workshops distributed in
the whole neighbourhood round Pressigny.</p>

<p>At the time of this discovery, that is in 1864, flints were found in
thousands imbedded in the vegetable mould on the surface of the soil,
over a superficies of 12 to 14 acres. The Abbé Chevalier, giving an
account of this curious discovery to the <i>Académie des Sciences</i> at
Paris, wrote: "It is impossible to walk a single step without treading
on some of these objects."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"> [Pg 148]</a></span></p>
<p>The workshops of Grand-Pressigny furnish us with a considerable
variety of instruments. We find hatchets in all stages of manufacture,
from the roughest attempt up to a perfectly polished weapon. We
find, also, long flakes or flint-knives cleft off with a single blow with
astonishing skill.</p>

<p>All these objects, even the most beautiful among them, are nevertheless
defective in some respect or other; hence it may be concluded
that they were the refuse thrown aside in the process of manufacture.
In this way may be explained the accumulation of so many of these
objects in the same spot.</p>

<p>There were likewise narrow and elongated points forming a kind of
piercer, perfectly wrought; also scrapers, and saws of a particular type
which seem to have been made in a special workshop. They are short
and wide, and have at each end a medial slot intended to receive a handle.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 105.&mdash;Nucleus in the Museum of
Saint-Germain, from the Workshop of Grand-Pressigny.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">But the objects which are the most numerous of all, and those
which obviate any doubt that Pressigny was once an important centre
of the manufacture of flint, are the <i>nuclei</i> (fig. 105), or the remnants
of the lump of flint, from which the large blades known under the
name of knives were cleft off. Some of these lumps which we have
seen in the Museum of St. Germain were as much as 11 and 13
inches in length; but the greater part did not exceed 7 inches. The
labourers of Touraine, who often turn up these flints with their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"> [Pg 149]</a></span>
plough-shares, call them <i>pounds of butter</i>, looking at the similarity of
shape. At the present day these <i>nuclei</i> are plentiful in all the collections
of natural history and geology.</p>

<p>A strange objection has been raised against the antiquity of the
hatchets, knives, and weapons found at Pressigny. M. Eugène Robert
has asserted that these flints were nothing else but the refuse of the
siliceous masses which, at the end of the last century and especially at
the beginning of the present, were used in the manufacture of gun-flints!</p>

<p>The Abbé Bourgeois, M. Penguilly l'Haridon, and Mr. John Evans
did not find much difficulty in proving the slight foundation there was
for this criticism. In the department of Loire-et-Cher, in which the
gun-flint manufacture still exists, the residue from the process bears no
resemblance whatever to the <i>nuclei</i> of Pressigny; the fragments are
much less in bulk, and do not present the same constantly-occurring
and regular shapes. Added to this, they are never chipped at the
edges, like a great number of the flakes coming from the workshops
of Touraine.</p>

<p>But another and altogether peremptory argument is that the flints
of Pressigny-le-Grand are unfitted, on account of the texture, for the
manufacture of gun-flints. Moreover, the records of the Artillery
Depôt, as remarked by M. Penguilly l'Haridon, librarian of the
Artillery Museum, do not make mention of the locality of Pressigny
having ever been worked for this purpose. Lastly, the oldest inhabitants
of the commune have testified that they never either saw or
heard of any body of workmen coming into the district to work flints.
M. Eugène Robert's hypothesis, which MM. Decaisne and Elie de
Beaumont thought right to patronise, is, therefore, as much opposed
to facts as to probability.</p>

<p>Very few polished flints are found in the workshops of Pressigny-le-Grand;
it is, therefore, imagined that their existence commenced
before the polished-stone epoch. According to this idea, the <i>nuclei</i>
would belong to a transitional epoch between the period of chipped
stone, properly so called, and that of polished stone. The first was
just coming to an end, but the second had not actually commenced. In
other words, most of the Pressigny flints have the typical shapes and
style of cutting peculiar to the polished-stone age, but the polishing
is wanting.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"> [Pg 150]</a></span></p>
<p>This operation was not practised in the workshops of Pressigny
until some considerable period after they were founded, and were
already in full operation. In the neighbourhood of this locality a
number of polishers have been found of a very remarkable character.
They are large blocks of sandstone (fig. 106), furrowed all over, or
only on a portion of their surface, with grooves of various depths,
in which objects might be polished by an energetic friction.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 106.&mdash;Polisher from
Grand-Pressigny, both faces being shown.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">Some polishers of the same kind, which have been found in various
departments, are rather different from the one we have just named.
Thus, one specimen which was found by M. Leguay in the environs
of Paris, in the burial-places of Varenne-Saint-Hilaire, of which we
give a representation further on, is provided not only with grooves
but also hollows of a basin-like shape, and of some little depth.</p>

<p>The polishing of the flints was carried into effect by rubbing them
against the bottom of these hollows, which were moistened by water,
and no doubt contained siliceous dust of a harder nature than the
stone which had to be polished.</p>

<p>We must here pause for a moment to remark that all these operations
which were carried out by our ancestors in fashioning the flint could
not fail to have presented certain difficulties, and must have required
a remarkable development of intelligence and skill.</p>

<p>Working flints into shape, which appears at first sight a very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"> [Pg 151]</a></span>
simple matter, is, however, a rather complicated operation, on account
of the properties of this mineral substance and the beds in which it
lies.</p>

<p>In its natural state the flint presents itself in the shape of nearly
round lumps, which are brittle, but nevertheless very hard, and which,
like glass, can be split in any direction by a blow, so as to furnish
scales with sharp edges. In consequence of this circumstance, all
that would be requisite in order to produce sharp objects is to cleave
off flakes in the shape of a knife or poniard, by striking a flint,
held in the left hand, with another and harder flint or hammer.
Instead of holding in the left hand the flint which was to be wrought,
it might also be placed on a rest and, being held fast with the left
hand, suitable blows might be applied to the stone.</p>

<p>We must not, however, omit to mention, that to enable the flint to
be cut up into sharp splinters and to be broken in any desired direction,
it is necessary for it to have been very recently extracted from the
bosom of the earth; it must possess the humidity which is peculiar to
it, with which it is impregnated when in its natural bed. If pieces of
flint are exposed to the open air they cannot afterwards be readily
broken with any degree of regularity; they then afford nothing but
shapeless and irregular chips, of an entirely different character from
that which would be required in fashioning them. This moisture was
well known to the workmen who used to manufacture the gun-flints,
and was called the <i>quarry damp</i>.</p>

<p>The necessity that the flint should be wrought when newly extracted
from the earth, and that the stones should only be dug just
in proportion as they were wanted, brought about as a proximate
result the creation and working of mines and quarries, which are
thus almost as ancient as humanity itself. Being unable to make
use of flints which had been dried in the air, and consequently
rendered unfit for being wrought, the workmen were compelled
to make excavations, and to construct galleries, either covered
or exposed to the open air, to employ wooden battening, shores,
supports; in short, to put in use the whole plant which is required for
working a stone-quarry. As, in order not to endanger the lives of
the labourers, it was found necessary to prevent any downfalls, they
were induced to follow out a certain methodical system in their excavations,
by giving a sufficient thickness to the roofs of the galleries,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"> [Pg 152]</a></span>
by sinking shafts, by building breast-walls, and by adopting the best
plan for getting out the useless <i>detritus</i>. When, as was often the
case, water came in so as to hinder the miners, it was necessary to
get rid of it in order that the workmen should not be drowned. It
was also sometimes requisite that the galleries and the whole system
of underground ways should be supplied with air.</p>

<p>Thus their labour in fashioning the flint must have led our ancestors
to create the art of working quarries and mines.</p>

<p>It has been made a subject of inquiry, how the tribes of the Stone
Age could produce, without the aid of any iron tool, the holes which
are found in the flints; and how they could perforate these same flints
so as to be able to fit in handles for the hatchets, poniards, and knives;
in fact, lapidaries of the present day cannot bore through gun-flints
without making use of diamond dust. We are of opinion that the
<i>bow</i>, which was employed by primitive man in producing fire by
rubbing wood against wood, was also resorted to in the workshops for
manufacturing stone implements and weapons for giving a rapid revolving
motion to a flint drill which was sufficient to perforate the
stone. Certain experiments which have been made in our own day
with very sharp arrow-heads which belonged to primitive man have
proved that it is thus very possible to pierce fresh flints, if the action
of the drill is assisted by the addition of some very hard dust which
is capable of increasing the bite of the instrument. This dust or
powder, consisting of corundum or zircon, might have been found
without any great difficulty by the men of the Stone Age. These substances
are, in fact, to be met with on the banks of rivers, their
presence being betrayed by the golden spangles which glitter in the
sand.</p>

<p>Thus the flint-drill, assisted by one of these powders, was quite
adequate for perforating siliceous stones. When it is brought to our
knowledge that the workmen of the Black Forest thus bore into
Bohemian granite in less than a minute, we shall not feel inclined to
call this explanation in question.<a name="fnanchor_19"

<p class="topspace2">In this sketch we have depicted the polisher found by M. Leguay,
of which we give a representation in fig. 108. In this picture
it was indispensable for us to show the operation of polishing, for the
latter is a characteristic of the epoch of mankind which we are now
describing, that is, the polished-stone period. It must, in fact, be
remarked that during the epoch of the great bear and the mammoth,
and the reindeer epoch, stone instruments were not polished, they
were purely and simply flakes or fragments of stone. During the
epoch at which we have now arrived, a great improvement took place
in this kind of work, and stone instruments were polished. It is
therefore essential to call attention to the latter operation.</p>

alt="Polisher"  />
<div class="caption">Fig. 108.&mdash;Polisher found by M. Leguay.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">We think we ought to quote here the brief account M. Leguay has
given of the polisher represented in our figure. In his 'Note sur une
Pierre à polir les Silex trouvée en Septembre, 1860, à la Varenne-Saint-Hilaire
(Seine),' M. Leguay thus writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Amongst the many monuments of the Stone Age which I have
collected at Varenne-Saint-Hilaire, on the site of the ancient settlement
which once existed there, there is one which has always struck
me, not only by its good state of preservation, but also by the revelations
which it affords us as to one of the principal manufactures of
these tribes&mdash;the fabrication of flint weapons and utensils.</p>

<p>"This object is a stone for polishing and fashioning the finest kind
of hatchets. I discovered it in September, 1860, at a spot called <i>La
Pierre au Prêtre</i>, along with several other monuments of primitive
art which I intend before long to make public. This stone is a rough
sandstone of cubical shape, showing no trace whatever of having been
hewn. It is 13 inches in its greatest thickness, and measures 37
inches long by 21 wide, and, just as in many boulders, one of its
faces is well adapted to the use for which it was employed.</p>

<p>"This is the face which was used for many long years for rubbing
and polishing the weapons made in the place, the remains of
which are still found in small quantities in the neighbourhood, and
abound in the burial-places, where they have been deposited as votive
offerings.</p>

<p>"Almost the whole of its surface is occupied. In the centre is a
basin presenting an oval surface 25 inches the long way, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"> [Pg 154]</a></span>
12 inches the narrow way. The stone, which has been considerably
worn away in consequence of long use, has been rubbed off to a
central depth of about 1 inch; this portion must have been used
for rubbing the larger objects after they had been roughly shaped by
chipping. The length of the basin allowed a motion of considerable
length to be given to the stone which was being worked, at the same
time giving facilities to the workman for the exercise of all his strength.
Added to this, this cavity enabled the almond-like shape to be given
to the objects&mdash;a form which they nearly all present.</p>

<p>"Either in front or to the right, according to the position in which
the observer stands, and almost touching the edge of this basin, there
is a hole deeply hollowed in the stone, being 30 inches long; it
extends along almost the whole length of the sandstone, with the
maximum breadth of about 1 inch, and presents the shape of a very
elongated spindle hollowed out to a depth of something less than half
an inch in the centre, which tapers off to nothing at the two ends.</p>

<p>"The wear of the stone and the shape of this groove point out its
intention. It must have been used to reduce the edges or the sides of
the hatchet, which after the chipping and flat polishing were left either
too thick or too sharp for a handle to be easily fitted to them. Added
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"> [Pg 155]</a></span>
to this, it smoothed down the roughnesses caused by chipping, which
it replaced by a round form of no great thickness, which was again
and again rubbed flatly on the stone to give it a square and sharp-edged
level. This last operation took place in a basin, and it gave to
the hatchet a curve in a lengthwise direction which is by no means
ungraceful.</p>

<p>"The thinning off of the edges of the groove was not an immaterial
matter. It not only assisted in forming the above-named curve, but
also prevented the cutting edge being distorted, and avoided the need
of subsequent repolishing, which spoiled the object by rubbing it away
too much.</p>

<p>"It must not be for a moment imagined that the edge of the
hatchet was made in this groove. Examination proves the contrary,
and that it was done flatwise while polishing the rest of the object;
and if sometimes its thickness did not allow this, it was preliminarily
done, and then finished in the general polishing.</p>

<p>"But although this basin, and its accompanying groove, on account
of their dimensions, acted very well for polishing the large hatchets,
the case was different with the smaller ones. This is the reason why
two other smaller basins, and also a small groove, were made on the
flat part of the stone by the side of the others.</p>

<p>"These two basins were placed at two corners of the face of the
stone, but still parallel to the larger basin and also to the larger
groove, so as to be convenient for the requirements of the workman
engaged in polishing without compelling him to shift his
position; one is 10 inches, and the other 13 inches in length,
with a mean breadth of about 2&frac12; inches. They are both in the
shape of a rather narrow almond, and end almost in a point, which
seems to show that they also were used in polishing somewhat narrow
objects&mdash;perhaps to set right the edges of hatchets, in which the
rubbing in the larger basin had produced cavities prejudicial to the
perfection of the faces.</p>

<p>"The small groove, placed very near the larger one, is 9 inches
long. It is the same shape as the other, but is not so deep, and
scarcely half an inch wide.</p>

<p>"Not far from the end of this latter groove, at the point where it
approaches the larger one, there are traces of a groove scarcely commenced.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"> [Pg 156]</a></span></p>
<p>"Lastly, the flat portions of the stone which are not occupied by
the basins and grooves, were sometimes used for touching up the
polish, or even for smoothing various objects.</p>

<p>"Thus, as we see, this polishing-stone, which is one of the most
complete in existence, has on it three basins of different sizes, two
well-defined grooves, and one only just sketched out. It would serve
for finishing off all the instruments that could be required; but, nevertheless,
two other sandstones of moderate size were found near it; one
round, and the other of a spindle-like shape; these, which were worn
and rubbed all over their surfaces, must also have been used in
polishing objects.</p>

<p>"Finding these stones was, however, a thing of frequent occurrence
in several spots of this locality, where I often met with them; they
were of all sizes and all shapes, and perfectly adapted for polishing
small flints, needles, and the cutting edges of knives, deposited with
them in the sepulchres.</p>

<p>"This polishing-stone, which is thickly covered with <i>dendrites</i> or
incrustations, must have been in use at the time it was abandoned. I
found it about 2 feet below the surface of the soil, in which it was
turned upside down; that is, the basin lay next the earth. The few
monuments that were with it&mdash;one among which I looked upon as an
idol roughly carved in a block of sandstone&mdash;were all likewise turned
upside down. There had been sepulchres in the neighbourhood, but
they had been violated; and the displaced stones, as well as the bones
themselves, only served to point out the presence of the former burial-place."</p>

<p>The polishing of stone instruments was effected by rubbing the
object operated upon in a cavity hollowed out in the centre of the
polisher, in which cavity a little water was poured, mixed with zircon
or corundum powder, or, perhaps, merely with oxide of iron, which is
used by jewellers in carrying out the same operation.</p>

<p>It is really surprising to learn what an enormous quantity of flints
could be prepared by a single workman, provided with the proper
utensils. For information on this point, it is requisite to know what
could be done by our former flint-workers in the departments of Indre
and Loire-et-Cher, who are, in fact, the descendants of the workmen of
the Stone Age. Dolomieu, a French naturalist, desired at the beginning
of the century to acquaint himself with the quantity which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"> [Pg 157]</a></span>
these workmen could produce, and at the same time to thoroughly
understand the process which they employed in manufacturing gun-flints.</p>

<p>By visiting the workshops of the flint-workers, M. Dolomieu ascertained
that the first shape which the workmen gave to the flint
was that of a many-sided prism. In the next place, five or six blows
with the hammer, which were applied in a minute, were sufficient to
cleave off from the mass certain fragments as exact in shape, with
faces as smooth, outlines as straight, and angles as sharp, as if the
stone had been wrought by a lapidary's wheel&mdash;an operation which,
in the latter case, would have required an hour's handiwork. All
that was requisite, says Dolomieu, is that the stones should be fresh,
and devoid of flaws or heterogeneous matter. When operating upon
a good kind of flint, freshly extracted from the ground, a workman
could prepare 1000 proper flakes of flint in a day, turning out
500 gun-flints, so that in three days he would perfectly finish 1000
ready for sale. In 1789, the Russian army was furnished with gun-flints
from Poland. The manufactory was established at Kisniew.
At this period, according to Dolomieu, 90,000 of these gun-flints
were made in two months.</p>

<p>Besides those at Grand-Pressigny, some other pre-historic workshops
have been pointed out in France. We may mention those of
Charente, discovered by M. de Rochebrune; also those of Poitou, and
lastly, the field of Diorières, at Chauvigny (Loire-et-Cher), which
appears to have been a special workshop for polishing flint instruments.
There is, in fact, not far from Chauvigny, in the same department,
a rock on which twenty-five furrows, similar to those in the
polishing-stones, are still visible; on which account the inhabitants of
the district have given it the name of the "Scored Rock." It is
probable that this rock was used for polishing the instruments which
were sculptured at Diorières.</p>

<p>The same kind of open-air workshops for the working of flints
have also been discovered in Belgium.</p>

<p>The environs of Mons are specially remarkable in this respect. At
Spiennes, particularly, there can be no doubt that an important manufactory
of wrought flints existed during the polished-stone epoch. A
considerable number of hatchets and other implements have been
found there; all of them being either unfinished, defective, or scarcely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"> [Pg 158]</a></span>
commenced. We here give a representation (fig. 109) of a spear-head
which came from this settlement.</p>

<div class="figcenter topspace2"><a name="i_207.jpg" id="i_207.jpg"></a>

<div class="caption">Fig. 109.&mdash;Spear-head from Spiennes.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">Sometimes these workshops were established in caverns, and not in
the open air. We are told this by M. J. Fournet, a naturalist of
Lyons, in his work entitled, 'Influence du Mineur sur la Civilisation.'</p>

<p>"For a very long time past," says M. Fournet, "the caves of
Mentone had been known to the inhabitants of the district, on account
of the accumulation of <i>débris</i> contained in them, a boxful of which
were sent to Paris, before 1848, by the Prince of Monaco; the contents
of it, however, were never subjected to any proper explanation.
Since this date, M. Grand, of Lyons, to whom I am indebted for a
collection of specimens from these caves, carefully made several excavations,
by which he was enabled to ascertain that the most remarkable
objects are only to be met with at a certain depth in the clayey
deposit with which the soil of these caves is covered. All the instruments
are rough and rudimentary in their character, and must,
consequently, be assigned to the first commencement of the art.
Nevertheless, among the flints some agates were found, which, in my
opinion, certainly came from the neighbourhood of Frejus; and with
them also some pieces of hyaline quartz in the shape of prisms
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"> [Pg 159]</a></span>
terminated by their two ordinary pyramids. We have a right to
suppose that these crystals, which resembled the <i>Meylan diamonds</i>
found near Grenoble, did not come there by chance, and that their
sharp points, when fixed in a handle and acting as drills, were used
for boring holes in stone."</p>

<p>Flint was not, however, the only substance used during this epoch
in the manufacture of stone-hatchets, instruments and tools. In the
caves of France, Belgium and Denmark a considerable number of
hatchets have been found, made of gneiss, diorite, ophite, fibrolite,
jade, and various other very hard mineral substances, which were
well adapted to the purpose required and the use to which they
were put.</p>

<p>Among the most remarkable we may mention several jade hatchets
which were found in the department of Gers, and ornamented with
small hooks on each side of the edge. One of these beautiful jade
hatchets (fig. 110), the delineation of which is taken from the
specimen in the Museum of Saint-Germain, was found in the department
of Seine-et-Oise; it has a sculptured ridge in the middle of
each face.</p>

<div class="figcenter topspace2"><a name="i_208.jpg" id="i_208.jpg"></a>

alt="Polished Jade Hatchet"  />
<div class="caption">Fig. 110.&mdash;Polished Jade Hatchet in

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">But neither flint, gneiss, nor diorite exist in every country. For
these stones some less hard substance was then substituted. In
Switzerland the instruments and tools were generally made of pebbles
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"> [Pg 160]</a></span>
which had been drifted down by the streams. They were fashioned
by breaking them with other stones, by rubbing them on sandstone,
or by sawing them with toothed blades of flint according to their
cohesive nature.</p>

<p>In some localities also objects of large size were made of serpentine,
basalts, lavas, jades, and other rocks chosen on account of their
extreme cohesiveness.</p>

<p>Manual skill had, however, attained such a pitch of perfection
among the workmen of this period, in consequence of their being
habituated to one exclusive kind of labour, that the nature of the stone
became a matter of indifference to them. The hammer, with the
proper use of which our workmen are almost unacquainted, was a
marvellous instrument in the hands of our ancestors; with it they
executed prodigies of workmanship, which seem as if they ought to
have been reserved for the file and grindstone of the lapidary of the
present day.</p>

<p>We shall not, perhaps, surprise our readers if we add that as
certain volcanic lavas, especially obsidian, fracture with the same
regularity and the same facility as the flint, obsidian was employed
by the natives of America as a material for making
sharp instruments. The ancient quarries whence the Indians
procured this rock for the manufacture of instruments and tools,
were situate at the <i>Cerro de Navajas</i>&mdash;that is, the <i>Mountain
of Knives</i>&mdash;in Mexico. M. H. de Saussure, the descendant of the
great geologist, was fortunate enough to meet with, at this spot,
pieces of mineral which had merely been begun upon, and allowed a
series of double-edged blades to be subsequently cut off them; these
were always to be obtained by a simple blow skilfully applied.
According to M. H. de Saussure, the first fashioning of these implements
was confined to producing a large six-sided prism, the vertical
corners of which were regularly and successively hewn off, until the
piece left, or <i>nucleus</i>, became too small for the operation to be further
continued.</p>

<p>Hernandez, the Spanish historian, states that he has seen 100
blades an hour manufactured in this way. Added to this, the ancient
aborigines of Peru, and the Guanches of Teneriffe, likewise carved
out of obsidian both darts and poniards. And, lastly, we must not
omit to mention that M. Place, one of the explorers of Nineveh, found
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"> [Pg 161]</a></span>
on the site of this ancient city, knives of obsidian, supposed to be used
for the purpose of circumcision.</p>

<p>Having considered the flint instruments peculiar to the polished-stone
epoch, we must now turn our attention to those made of stag's
horn.</p>

<p>The valley of the Somme, which has furnished such convincing
proof of the co-existence of man with the great mammals of extinct
species, is a no less precious repository for instruments of stag's horn
belonging to the polished-stone epoch. The vast peat-bogs of this
region are the localities where these relics have been chiefly found.
Boucher de Perthes collected a considerable number of them in the
neighbourhood of Abbeville.</p>

<p>These peat-bogs are, as is well known, former marshes which have
been gradually filled up by the growth of peat-moss (sphagnum),
which, mixed with fallen leaves, wood, &amp;c.,
and being slowly rotted by the surrounding
water, became converted after a certain
time into that kind of combustible matter
which is called peat. The bogs in the valley
of the Somme in some places attain to the
depth of 34 feet. In the lower beds of
this peat are found the weapons, the tools,
and the ornaments of the polished-stone
epoch.</p>

<p>Among these ancient relics we must mention
one very interesting class; it is that formed
by the association of two distinct component
parts, such as stone and stag's horn, or stone
and bone.</p>

<p>The hatchets of this type are particularly
remarkable; they consist of a piece of polished
flint half buried in a kind of sheath of stag's
horn, either polished or rough as the case may
be (fig. 111).</p>

<p class="topspace2">The middle of this sheath is generally
perforated with a round or oval hole intended to receive a handle of
oak, birch, or some other kind of wood adapted for such a use.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"> [Pg 162]</a></span></p>
<p>Fig. 112, taken from the illustration in Boucher de Perthes' work
('Antiquités Celtiques et Antédiluviennes'), represents this hatchet
fitted into a handle made of oak.</p>

</div>

<p class="topspace2">It is difficult to understand how it was that a hatchet of this kind
did not fall out of its sheath in consequence of any moderately violent
blow; for it seems as if there was nothing to hold it in its place.
This observation especially applies to hatchets, the whole length of
which&mdash;even the portion covered by the sheath&mdash;was polished; for the
latter would certainly slide out of their casing with ease. The fact
is, that complete specimens are seldom found, and, generally speaking,
the flints are separated from their sheaths.</p>

<p>With regard to the handles, the nature of the material they were
made from was unfavourable to their preservation through a long
course of centuries; it is, therefore, only exceptionally that we meet
with them, and even then they are always defaced.</p>

<p>Fig. 113 is given by Boucher de Perthes, in his 'Antiquités
Celtiques,' as the representation of an oaken handle found by him.</p>

<p>A number of these sheaths have been found, which were provided
at the end opposite to the stone hatchet with strong and pointed teeth.
These are boar's tusks, firmly buried in the stag's horn. These
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"> [Pg 163]</a></span>
instruments therefore fulfilled a double purpose; they cut or crushed
with one end and pierced with the other.</p>

<p>Sheaths are also found which are not only provided with the boar's
tusks, but are hollowed out at each end so as to hold two flint
hatchets at once. This is represented in fig. 114 from one of
Boucher de Perthes' illustrations.</p>

<p class="topspace2">The hatchet fitted into a sheath of stag's horn which we here
delineate (fig. 115), was picked up in the environs of Aerschot, and is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"> [Pg 164]</a></span>
an object well worthy of note; it is now in the Museum of Antiquities
at Brussels. Its workmanship is perfect, and superior to that of
similar instruments found in the peat-bogs of the valley of the Somme.</p>

<p class="topspace2">Stag's horn was often used alone as a material for the manufacture
of tools which were not intended to endure any very hard work;
among these were instruments of husbandry and gardening.</p>

<p>We here give representations (figs. 116, 117, 118) from Boucher
de Perthes' illustrations, of certain implements made of stag's horn
which appear to have had this purpose in view. It is remarked that
they are not all perforated for holding a handle; in some cases, a
portion of the stag's antler formed the handle.</p>

<p class="topspace2">In the course of his explorations in the peat-bogs of Abbeville,
M. Boucher de Perthes found numerous flakes of flint of irregular
shapes, the use of which he was unable to explain. But there have
also been discovered in the same deposits some long bones belonging
to mammals&mdash;tibia, femur, radius, ulna&mdash;all cut in a uniform way,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"> [Pg 165]</a></span>
either in the middle or at the ends; he was led to imagine that
these bones might have been the handles intended to hold the flints.
In order to assure himself that this idea was well founded, he took
one of the bones and a stone which came out of the peat, and, having
put them together, he found he had made a kind of chisel, well-adapted
for cutting, scooping-out, scratching and polishing horn or
wood. He tried this experiment again several times, and always with
full success. If the stone did not fit firmly into the bone, one or two
wooden wedges were sufficient to steady it.</p>

<p>After this, Boucher de Perthes entertained no doubt whatever
that these bones had been formerly employed as handles for flint
implements. The same handle would serve for several stones, owing
to the ease with which the artisan could take one flint out and replace
it with another, by the aid of nothing but these wooden wedges. This
is the reason why, in the peat-bogs, flints of this sort are always
much more plentiful than the bone handles. We must also state
that it seems as if they took little or no trouble in repairing the flints
when they were blunted, knowing how easy it would be to replace them.
They were thrown away, without further care; hence their profusion.</p>

<p>These handles are made of extremely hard bone, from which we may
conclude that they were applied to operations requiring solid tools.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"> [Pg 166]</a></span>
Most of them held the flint at one end only; but some were open at
both ends, and would serve as handles for two tools at once.</p>

<p>Figs. 119 and 120 represent some of these flint tools in bone
handles&mdash;the plates are taken from those in Boucher de Perthes'
work.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 120.&mdash;Flint Tool with Bone Handle.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">Generally speaking, these handles gave but little trouble to those
who made them. They were content with merely breaking the bone
across, without even smoothing down the fracture, and then enlarging
the medullary hollow which naturally existed; next they roughly
squared or rounded the end which was intended to be grasped by the
hand.</p>

<p>In fig. 121, we delineate one of these bone handles which is much
more carefully fashioned; it has been cut off smooth at the open end,
and the opposite extremity has been rounded off into a knob, which is
ornamented with a design.</p>

<div class="figcenter topspace2"><a name="i_215c.jpg" id="i_215c.jpg"></a>

<div class="caption">Fig. 121.&mdash;Ornamented Bone Handle.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">During the polished-stone epoch, as during that which preceded it,
the teeth of certain mammals were used in the way of ornament.
But they were not content, as heretofore, with merely perforating
them with holes and hanging them in a string round their necks;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"> [Pg 167]</a></span>
they were now wrought with considerable care. The teeth of the
wild boar were those chiefly selected for this purpose. They were
split lengthwise, so as to render them only half their original thickness,
and were then polished and perforated with holes in order to
string them.</p>

<p>In the peat-mosses of the valley of the Somme a number of
boars' tusks have been found thus fashioned. The most curious
discovery of this kind which has been made, was that of the object of
which we give a sketch in fig. 122. It was found in 1834, near
Pecquigny (Somme), and is composed of nineteen boars' tusks split
into two halves, as we before mentioned, perfectly polished, and perforated
at each end with a round hole. Through these holes was
passed a string of some tendinous substance, the remains of which
were, it is stated, actually to be seen at the time of the discovery.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"> [Pg 168]</a></span> A
necklace of this kind must have been of considerable value, as it would
have necessitated a large amount of very tedious and delicate work.</p>

<p class="topspace2">In the peat-bogs near Brussels polished flints have likewise been
found, associated with animal bones, and two specimens of the human
<i>humerus</i>, belonging to two individuals.</p>

<p>The peat-bogs of Antwerp, in which were found a human frontal
bone, characterised by its great thickness, and its small surface, have
also furnished fine specimens of flint knives (fig. 123), which are in
no way inferior to the best of those discovered at Grand-Pressigny.</p>

<p class="topspace2">On none of the instruments of bone or horn, of which we have
been speaking, are to be found the designs which we have described
as being the work of man during the reindeer epoch. The artistic
instinct seems to have entirely vanished. Perhaps the diluvial
catastrophe, which destroyed so many victims, had, as one of its
results, the effect of effacing the feeling of art, by forcing men to
concentrate their ideas on one sole point&mdash;the care of providing for
their subsistence and defence.</p>

<p>A quantity of remains, gathered here and there, bear witness to the
fact that in the polished-stone epoch the use of pottery was pretty
widely spread. Most of the specimens are, as we have said, nothing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"> [Pg 169]</a></span>
but attempts of a very rough character, but still they testify to a
certain amount of progress. The ornamentation is more delicate and
more complicated. We notice the appearance of open-work handles,
and projections perforated for the purpose of suspension. In short,
there is a perceptible, though but preliminary step made towards the
real creations of art.</p>

<p>In the caves of Ariége, MM. Garrigou and Filhol found some
remains of ancient pottery of clay provided with handles, although
of a shape altogether primitive. Among the fragments of pottery
found by these <i>savants</i>, there was one which measured 11 inches in
height, and must have formed a portion of a vase 20 inches high.
This vessel, which was necessarily very heavy, had been hung to
cords; this was proved by finding on another portion of the same
specimen three holes which had been perforated in it.</p>


<p><i>Agriculture.</i>&mdash;We have certain evidence that man, during the
polished-stone epoch, was acquainted with husbandry, or, in other
words, that he cultivated cereals. MM. Garrigou and Filhol found
in the caves of Ariége more than twenty mill-stones, which could only
have been used in grinding corn. These stones are from 8 to 24
inches in diameter.</p>

<p>The tribes, therefore, which, during the polished-stone epoch, inhabited
the district now called Ariége, were acquainted with the
cultivation of corn.</p>

<p>In 1869, Dr. Foulon-Menard published an article intended to
describe a stone found at Penchasteau, near Nantes, in a tomb
belonging to the Stone Age.<a name="fnanchor_20"
id="fnanchor_20"></a><a href="#footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
This stone is 24 inches wide,
and hollowed out on its upper face. It was evidently used for
crushing grain with the help of a stone roller, or merely a round
pebble, which was rolled up and down in the cavity. The meal
obtained by this pressure and friction made its way down the slope
in the hollowing out of the stone, and was caught in a piece of
matting, or something of the kind.</p>

<p>To enable our readers to understand the fact that an excavation
made in a circular stone formed the earliest corn-mill in these primitive
ages, we may mention that, even in our own time, this is the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"> [Pg 170]</a></span>
mode of procedure practised among certain savage tribes in order to
crush various seeds and corn.</p>

</div>

<p class="topspace2">In the 'Voyage du Mississippi à l'Océan,' by M. Molhausen, we
read:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The principal food of the Indians consisted of roasted cakes of
maize and wheat, the grains of which had been pulverised <i>between
two stones</i>."<a name="fnanchor_21"
id="fnanchor_21"></a><a href="#footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>In Livingstone's Expedition to the Zambesi (Central Africa), it
is stated that "the corn-mills of the Mangajas, Makalolos, Landines
and other tribes are composed of a block of granite or syenite,
sometimes even of mica-schist, 15 to 18 inches square by 5 or
6 inches thick, and a piece of quartz, or some other rock of equal
hardness about the size of a half-brick; one of the sides of this
substitute for a millstone is convex, so as to fit into a hollow of a
trough-like shape made in the large block, which remains motionless.
When the woman wants to grind any corn, she kneels down, and,
taking in both hands the convex stone, she rubs it up and down
in the hollow of the lower stone with a motion similar to that of a
baker pressing down his dough and rolling it in front of him.
Whilst rubbing it to and fro, the housewife leans all her weight on
the smaller stone, and every now and then places a little more corn in
the trough. The latter is made sloping, so that the meal as soon as it
is made falls down into a cloth fixed to catch it."</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 125.&mdash;The Art of Bread-making in the Stone Age.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">Such, therefore, was the earliest corn-mill. We shall soon see it
reappear in another form; two mill-stones placed one over the other,
one being set in motion above the other by means of a wooden
handle. This is the corn-mill of the bronze epoch. This type
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"> [Pg 171]</a></span>
maintained its place down to historic times, as it constituted the
earliest kind of mill employed by the Roman agriculturist.</p>

<p>In order to represent the existence of agriculture during the
polished-stone epoch, we have annexed a delineation of a woman
grinding corn into meal in the primitive mill (fig. 125).</p>

<p>In the same figure may be noticed the way of preparing the meal
coming from the mill for making a rough kind of cake. The children
are heating in the fire some flat circular stones. When these stones
are sufficiently heated, they rapidly withdraw them from the fire,
using for the purpose two damp sticks; they then place on the
stones a little of the meal mixed with water. The heat of the stones
sufficed to bake the meal and form a sort of cake or biscuit.</p>

<p>We may here state, in order to show that we are not dealing with
a mere hypothesis, that it is just in this way that, in the poor districts
of Tuscany, the <i>polenta</i> is prepared even in the present day. The
dough made of chestnut-meal, moistened with water, is cooked between
flat stones that are placed one over the other in small piles as portrayed
in the annexed plate.</p>

<p>In the background of the same sketch we see animals, reduced to
the state of domestic cattle, being driven towards the group at work.
By this particular feature we have wished to point out that the
polished-stone epoch was also that of the domestication of animals,
and that even at this early period the sheep, the dog and the horse
had been tamed by man, and served him either as auxiliaries or
companions.</p>

<p>The traces of agriculture which we have remarked on as existing
in the caves of Ariége, are also found in other parts of France.
Round the hearths in the department of Puy-de-Dôme, M.
Pommerol discovered carbonised wheat intermingled with pottery and
flint instruments. The men of the period we are now considering
no longer devoted themselves exclusively to the pursuits of hunting
and fishing. They now began to exercise the noble profession of
agriculture, which was destined to be subsequently the chief source
of national wealth.</p>


<p><i>Navigation.</i>&mdash;The first origin of the art of navigation must be
ascribed to the polished-stone epoch. With regard to this subject,
let us pay attention to what is said on the point by M. G. de
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"> [Pg 172]</a></span>
Mortillet, curator at the Archæological and Pre-historic Museum of
Saint-Germain&mdash;one of the best-informed men we have in all questions
relating to the antiquity of man.</p>

<p>In M. de Mortillet's opinion, navigation, both marine and inland,
was in actual existence during the polished-stone epoch.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord topspace2"><a name="i_226.jpg" id="i_226.jpg"></a>

<div class="caption">Fig. 126.&mdash;The earliest Navigators.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">The earliest boats that were made by man consisted simply of
great trunks of trees, shaped on the outside, and hollowed out in
the interior. They were not provided with any rests or rowlocks for
the oars or paddles, which were wielded by both hands. In hollowing
out the tree they used both their stone implements and also the
action of fire.</p>

<p>In the earliest boats, the trunk of the tree, cut through at the two
ends as well as their imperfect tools allowed, preserved its original
outward form. The boat, in fact, was nothing but the trunk of a
tree first burnt out and then chipped on the inside by some cutting
instrument, that is, by the stone-hatchet.</p>

<p>Some improvement subsequently took place in making them. The
outside of the tree was also chipped, and its two ends, instead of
being cut straight through, were made to terminate in a point. In
order to give it more stability in the water and to prevent it from
capsizing, it was dressed equally all over, and the bottom of the
canoe was scooped out. Cross-stays were left in the interior to give
the boat more solidity, and perhaps, also, to serve as a support to the
back, or, more probably, to the feet of the rowers, who sat in the
bottom of the canoe.</p>

<p>Sails must soon have been added to these means of nautical progression.
But it would be a difficult matter to fix any precise date
for this important discovery, which was the point of transition between
elementary and primitive navigation, and more important voyages.
This progress could not have been made without the help of metals.</p>

<p>In an article entitled 'Origine de la Navigation et de la Pêche,'
M. de Mortillet passes in review all the discoveries, which have been
made in different countries, of the earliest boats belonging to pre-historic
man.</p>

<p>After stating that the Museum of Copenhagen contains drawings
of three ancient canoes, he goes on to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The first canoe is the half-trunk of a tree 17 inches wide,
cut straight at the two ends, about 7 feet in length, and hollowed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"> [Pg 173]</a></span>
out in a trough-like shape. This canoe much resembles that of
Switzerland.</p>

<p>"The second was about 10 feet in length, one end terminating in a
point, the other more rounded. It was formed of the trunk of a tree
hollowed out into two compartments, a kind of cross-stay or seat being
left at a point about one-third of the length from the widest end.</p>

<p>"The third canoe, No. 295, likewise made of the trunk of a tree, was
much longer, having a length of at least 13 feet, and was terminated
by a point at both ends. At the sharpest end, the hollow is
finished off squarely, and there is also a small triangular seat at the
extremity. Two cross-stays were left in the interior.</p>

<p>"These three canoes are classed in the bronze series; a note of
interrogation or doubt is, however, affixed to the two latter.</p>

<p>"Ireland, like Scandinavia, has a history which does not go back
very far into the remote past; like Scandinavia, too, Ireland has been
one of the first to collect with care not only the monuments, but even
the slightest relics of remote antiquity and of pre-historic times. The
Royal Irish Academy has collected at Dublin a magnificent Museum,
and the praiseworthy idea has also been put in practice of publishing
a catalogue illustrated with 626 plates.</p>

<p>"In these collections there are three ancient canoes. The first is
about 23 feet long, 31 inches wide, and 12 inches deep, and is hollowed
out of the trunk of an oak, which must have been at least 4&frac12; feet in
diameter. This boat, which came from the bogs of Cahore on the
coast of Wexford, is roughly squared underneath. One of the ends is
rounded and is slightly raised; the other is cut across at right angles,
and closed with a piece let in and fitted into grooves which were
caulked with bark. In the interior there are three cross-stays cut out
of the solid oak.</p>

<p>"The interior, at the time the canoe was discovered, contained a
wooden vessel, intended to bale out the boat, and two rollers, probably
meant to assist in conveying it down to the sea.</p>

<p>"The second is a canoe made of one piece of oak, rather more than
23 feet long, about 12 inches wide, and 8 inches deep. It terminates
in a point at both ends, and contains three cross-stays cut out of the
solid wood, and a small terminal triangular seat.</p>

<p>"The third, likewise made of one piece, is rather more than 20
feet long and about 21 inches wide. On each side the wood is cut
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"> [Pg 174]</a></span>
out so as to receive a seat. This boat appears less ancient than the
others, although these may not have belonged to any very remote
antiquity. In fact, Ware states that in his time there were still to
be seen on some of the Irish rivers canoes hollowed out of a single
trunk of oak.</p>

<p>"It is also well known that the lacustrine habitations constructed
on the artificial islands called <i>Crannoges</i>, existed to a late period in
Ireland. All the boats found round these island-dwellings are canoes
made all in one piece and hollowed out of the trunks of large trees.</p>

<p>"The trough-shaped canoe, consisting merely of the trunk of a tree
cut straight through at the two ends, and in no way squared on the
outside, also exists in Ireland. A very singular variety has been found
in the county of Monaghan;<a name="fnanchor_22"
id="fnanchor_22"></a><a href="#footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
at the two ends are two projections or
handles, which were probably used for carrying the boat from one
place to another, or to draw it up upon the beach after a voyage.</p>

<p>"According to Mr. John Buchanan, quoted by Sir C. Lyell,<a name="fnanchor_23"
id="fnanchor_23"></a><a href="#footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> at least
seventeen canoes have been found in the low ground along the margin
of the Clyde at Glasgow. Mr. Buchanan examined several of them
before they were dug out. Five of them were found buried in the silt
under the streets of Glasgow. One canoe was discovered in a vertical
position, with the prow upwards, as if it had foundered in a tempest;
it contained no small quantity of sea-shells. Twelve other canoes were
found about 100 yards from the river, at the average depth of about
19 feet below the surface of the ground, or about 7 feet below high-water
mark. A few only of them were found at a depth of no more
than 4 or 5 feet, and consequently more than 20 feet above the
present level of the sea. One was stuck into the sand at an angle
of 45°; another had been turned over and lay keel upwards; the
others were in a horizontal position, as if they had sunk in still
water.</p>

<p>"Almost every one of these ancient boats had been formed of a
single trunk of oak, and hollowed out with some blunt instrument,
probably stone hatchets, assisted also by the action of fire. A few of
them presented clean-made cuts, evidently produced by a metallic tool.
Two of them were constructed of planks. The most elaborate of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"> [Pg 175]</a></span>
number bore the traces of square metal nails, which, however, had
entirely disappeared. In one canoe was found a diorite hatchet, and
at the bottom of another, a cork bung, which certainly implies relations
with southern France, Spain, or Italy.</p>

<p>"The Swiss lakes, with their lacustrine habitations, have furnished
numerous specimens of canoes. Dr. Keller, in his fifth Report on Lake-Dwellings
(plate X. fig. 23), represents a canoe from Robenhausen;
it is the half trunk of a tree 12 feet long and 29 inches wide, hollowed
out to a depth of from 6 to 7 inches only. Taking the centre as the
widest part, this trunk has been chipped off so as to taper towards the
two points which are rounded. It is, however, very probable that the
whole of this work was executed with stone implements; for the primitive
settlement of Robenhausen, situated in a peat-bog near the small
lake Pfæffikon in the canton of Zurich, although very rich in many
kinds of objects, has not, up to the present time, furnished us with any
metal instruments.</p>

<p>"In his first report (plate IV. fig. 21), Dr. Keller had given the
sketch of another canoe which came from the Lake of Bienne. Like
the first, mentioned by M. Worsaae, it is the half of the trunk of a tree
cut almost straight through, its two ends hollowed out inside in the
shape of a trough, the exterior being left entirely unwrought.</p>

<p>"Professor Desor mentions several canoes found in the Lake of
Bienne. One of them, near the island Saint-Pierre, was still full of
stones. According to M. Desor the builders of the lacustrine habitations
during the polished-stone epoch, in order to consolidate the
piles which were intended to support their dwellings, were accustomed
to bank them up with stones which they fetched in boats from the
shore; the bottom of the lake being completely devoid of them.
The canoe found at the isle of Saint-Pierre had therefore sunk to the
bottom with its cargo, and thus may be dated back to the polished-stone
epoch. M. Troyon<a name="fnanchor_24"
id="fnanchor_24"></a><a href="#footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
gives some still more circumstantial
details as to this canoe. It is partly buried in the mud at the
northern angle of the isle, and is made of a single piece of the trunk
of an oak of large dimensions; it is not much less than 49 feet long
with a breadth of from 3&frac12; feet to 4 feet.</p>

<p>"M. Desor, in his <i>Palafittes</i>, informs us that the Museum of
Neuchâtel has lately been enriched by the addition of a canoe which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"> [Pg 176]</a></span>
was discovered in the lake; unfortunately, it was dreadfully warped
in drying.</p>

<p>"Also M. Troyon, in his 'Habitations Lacustres,' speaks of several
canoes at Estavayer and Morges.</p>

<p>"Estavayer is situated on the Lake of Neuchâtel. There are two
settlements near it, one of the Stone Age, and one of the bronze age.
One canoe is still lying at the bottom of the lake, near these settlements.
Another was brought out of the water by the fishermen
some years ago; it was about 10 feet in length, and 2 feet in width.
The end which had been preserved was cut to a point and slightly
turned upwards.</p>

<p>"Morges is on the Lake of Geneva, in the Canton of Vaud. M.
Forel discovered there two interesting settlements of the bronze
age. Two canoes were found. According to M. Troyon, one of them
which had been carried up on to the bank was not long before it was
destroyed. It was formed of the trunk of an oak, hollowed out
like a basin. The other still lay near some piles in 13 to 15 feet of
water. One portion of it is buried in the sand, the other part, which
is not covered, measures about 10 feet in length by 2 feet in width.
It terminates in a point and has been cut out so as to provide a kind
of seat, taken out of the thickness of the wood at the end, just as in
the third canoe represented in the catalogue of the Copenhagen
Museum.</p>

<p>"In France, too, several canoes have been found which date back
to pre-historic times.</p>

<p>"On the 6th of January, 1860, the labourers who were working at
the fortifications which the engineers were making at Abbeville found
a canoe in the place called Saint-Jean-des-Prés, on the left bank of
the canal; it was discovered in the peat, 36 feet below the road
and about 220 yards from the railway station. It was made out of a
single stick of oak and was about 22 feet in length; its ends
were square and cut in a slope, so that its upper surface was 8
feet longer than its bottom, which was flattened off to a width of
about 14 inches. The greatest width of its upper surface, the widest
part being placed at about one-third of its length, measured nearly
3 feet; from this point the canoe contracted in width, and was not
more than 18 inches in width at the furthest end. Now, as no tree
exists which diminishes to this extent in diameter on so short a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"> [Pg 177]</a></span>
length, we must conclude that the trunk which formed the canoe must
have been shaped outside.</p>

<p>"Two projections about 4 inches in thickness, placed 6&frac12; feet
from the narrowest end, and forming one piece with the sides and
the bottom, which in this part are very thick, left between them
an empty space which was probably intended to fit against the two
sides of a piece of wood cut square at the bottom and meant to serve
as a mast. The deepest internal hollow had not more than 10
inches in rise, and the side, which at the upper part was not more
than an inch in thickness, followed the natural curve of the trunk,
and united with the much thicker portion at the bottom. This canoe,
although it was completely uncovered and still remained in a very
good state of preservation, has not been got out from the place in
which it lay.</p>

<p>"In 1834, another canoe was discovered at Estreb&#339;uf, 33 feet
long, about 21 inches wide, and 18 inches deep. The bottom was flat,
the sides cut vertically both within and without, which gave it nearly
the shape of a squared trough. In its widest part it bore some
signs of having carried a mast. It was conveyed to the Museum at
Abbeville and became completely rotten; nothing now is left but
shapeless remains.</p>

<p>"The Abbé Cochet relates that between 1788 and 1800, during
the excavation of the basin of <i>La Barre</i>, at Havre, at 11 feet in
depth, a canoe was discovered, more than 44 feet in length, and
hollowed out of one trunk of a tree. The two ends were pointed
and solid, and the interior was strengthened with curved stays formed
out of the solid wood. This canoe was found to be made of elm and
was hollowed out to a depth of nearly 4 feet. It was in so good a
state of preservation that it bore being carried to a spot behind
the engineer's house on the south jetty; but when it was deposited
there, it gradually wasted away by the successive action of the rain
and sun.</p>

<p>"The same archæologist also mentions another canoe, with a keel of
from 16 to 20 feet long, which was discovered in the year 1680,
at Montéviliers, in the filled-up ditches known under the name
of La Bergue.</p>

<p>"The Archæological Museum of Dijon also contains a canoe found
in the gravel in the bed of the Loue, on the boundaries of the department
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"> [Pg 178]</a></span>
of Jura, between Dôle and Salins. It is made of a single
colossal trunk of oak, shaped, in M. Baudot's opinion, by means of
fire. Its present length is 17 feet, and its width, 2 feet 4 inches;
but it has become much less in the process of drying. Some
iron braces which were fixed to keep the wood in position plainly
showed that the width had diminished at least 6 inches. In the
interior, the traces of two seats or supports, which had been left in
the solid wood in order to give strength to the canoe, might be very
distinctly seen. The first was about a yard from one end, the other
5&frac12; feet from the other. Both extremities terminate in a point, one
end being much sharper and longer than the other.</p>

<p>"At the Museum of Lyons there is a canoe which was found in
the gravel of the Rhone, near the bridge of Cordon, in the department
of Ain. It is 41 feet in length, and hollowed out of a single
trunk of oak tapering off at the two ends. The middle of it is
squared, and the interior is strengthened by two braces left in the
solid wood.</p>

<p>"Lastly, we must mention the canoe that was dug out of the bed
of the Seine in Paris, and presented by M. Forgeais to the Emperor.
It is now in the Museum of Saint-Germain. It was made of a single
trunk of oak and had been skilfully wrought on the outside, terminating
in a point at both ends. This canoe was bedded in the mud
and gravel at the extremity of the <i>Cité</i>, on the Notre-Dame side.
Close by a worked flint was met with, and various bronze weapons;
among others, a helmet and several swords were also found. In the
beds of rivers objects belonging to different epochs readily get mixed
up. This flint appears to have accidentally come thither; the bronze
arms, on the contrary, seem to mark the date of the canoe."<a name="fnanchor_25"
id="fnanchor_25"></a><a href="#footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>We have previously spoken of the <i>primitive workshop of human
industry</i>, of which, indeed, we gave a design. In contrast to this
peaceful picture, we may also give a representation of the evidences
which have been preserved even to our own days of the earliest means
of attack and defence constituting regular war among nations. War
and battles must have doubtless taken their rise almost simultaneously
with the origin of humanity itself. The hatred and rivalry which
first sprung up between individuals and families&mdash;hatred and rivalry
which must have existed from all time&mdash;gradually extended to tribes,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"> [Pg 179]</a></span>
and then to whole nations, and were outwardly expressed in armed
invasions, pillage and slaughter. These acts of violence were, in very
early days, reduced to a system in the art of war&mdash;that terrible
expedient from which even modern nations have not been able to
escape.</p>

<p>In order to find the still existing evidence of the wars which took
place among men in the Stone Age, we must repair to that portion of
Europe which is now called Belgium. Yes, even in the Stone Age, at
a date far beyond all written record, the people of this district already
were in the habit of making war, either among themselves or against
other tribes invading them from other lands. This fact is proved by
the fortified enclosures, or <i>entrenched camps</i>, which have been discovered
by MM. Hannour and Himelette. These camps are those of
Furfooz, Pont-de-Bonn, Simon, Jemelle, Hastedon, and Poilvache.</p>

<p>All these different camps possess certain characteristics in common.
They are generally established on points overhanging valleys, on a
mass of rock forming a kind of headland, which is united to the rest
of the country by a narrow neck of land. A wide ditch was dug across
this narrow tongue of land, and the whole camp was surrounded by a
thick wall of stones, simply piled one upon another, without either
mortar or cement. At the camp of Hastedon, near Namur, this wall,
which was still in a good state of preservation at the time it was
described, measured 10 feet in width, and about the same in height.
When an attack was made, the defenders, assembled within the enclosure,
rained down on their assailants stones torn away from their
wall, which thus became at the same time both a defensive and
offensive work (fig. 127).</p>

alt="Earliest regular conflicts"  />
<div class="caption">Fig. 127.&mdash;The earliest regular Conflicts between
Men of the Stone Age; or, the Entrenched Camp of Furfooz.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">These entrenched positions were so well chosen that most of them
continued to be occupied during the age which followed. We may
mention, as an instance, the camp of Poilvache. After having been
a Roman citadel it was converted in the middle ages into a strongly
fortified castle, which was not destroyed until the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>The camps of Hastedon and Furfooz were likewise utilised by the
Romans.</p>

<p>Over the whole inclosure of these ancient camps worked flints
and remains of pottery have been found&mdash;objects which are sufficient
to testify to the former presence of primitive man. The enormous
ramparts of these camps also tend to show that pre-historic man must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"> [Pg 180]</a></span>
have existed in comparatively numerous associations at the various
spots where these works are found.</p>

<p>If we were to enter into a detailed study of the vestiges of the
polished-stone epoch existing in the other countries of Europe, we
should be led into a repetition of much that we have already stated
with regard to the districts now forming France and Belgium.
Over a great portion of Europe we should find the same mode
of life, the same manners and customs, and the same degree of
nascent civilisation. From the scope, therefore, of our present work,
we shall not make it our task to take each country into special
consideration.</p>

<p>We will content ourselves with stating that the caves of Old Castille
in Spain, which were explored by M. Ed. Lartet, have furnished
various relics of the reindeer and polished-stone epochs. Also in the
provinces of Seville and Badajos, polished hatchets have been found,
made for the most part of dioritic rocks.</p>

<p>Numerous vestiges of the same epoch have, too, been discovered in
various provinces of Italy.</p>

<p>We give in fig. 128 the sketch of a very remarkable arrow-head
found in the province of Civita-Nova (the former kingdom of Naples).
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"> [Pg 181]</a></span>
It is provided with a short stem with lateral grooves, so as to facilitate
the point being fitted into a wooden shaft.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 128.&mdash;Flint Arrow-head, from Civita-Nova (Italy).
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">Elba, too, was surveyed by M. Raffaello Foresi, who found in this
Mediterranean isle a large quantity of arrows, knives, saws, scrapers,
&amp;c., formed of flint, jasper, obsidian, and even rock crystal. There
were also found in the Isle of Elba workshops for shaping flints.
Great Britain, Wurtemburg, Hungary, Poland, and Russia all furnish
us with specimens of polished stone instruments; but, for the reason
which we stated above, it would be superfluous to dwell upon them.</p>

<p>We shall now pass on to an examination of the type of the human
race which existed among the northern nations of Europe during the
polished-stone age.</p>

<p>There is a cavern of Ariége which belongs to the polished-stone
epoch, and has been explored by MM. Garrigou and Filhol&mdash;this is
the cavern of <i>Lombrive</i>, or <i>des Echelles</i>; the latter name being given
it because it is divided into two portions placed at such very different
levels that the help of five long ladders is required in order to pass
from one to the other. This cave has become interesting from the
fact that it has furnished a large quantity of human bones, belonging
to individuals of both sexes and every age; also two entire skulls,
which M. Garrigou has presented to the Anthropological Society of
Paris.</p>

<p>These two skulls, which appear to have belonged, one to a child of
eight to ten years of age, the other to a female, present a somewhat
peculiar shape. The forehead, which is high in the centre, is low at
the sides; and the orbits of the eyes and also the hollows of the
cheeks are deep.</p>

<p>We shall not enter into the diverse and contrary hypotheses which
have been advanced by MM. Vogt, Broca, Pruner-Bey, Garrigou and
Filhol, in order to connect the skulls found in the cave of Ariége with
the present races of the human species. This ethnological question is
very far from having been decided in any uniform way; and so it
will always be, as long as scientific men are compelled to base their
opinions on a limited number of skulls, which are, moreover, always
incomplete; each <i>savant</i> being free to interpret their features according
to his own system.</p>

<p>Neither in the Danish kitchen-middens nor in the lower beds of
the peat-bogs have any human bones been discovered; but the tombs
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"> [Pg 182]</a></span>
in Denmark belonging to the polished-stone epoch have furnished a
few human skulls which, up to a certain point, enable us to estimate
the intellectual condition and affinities of the race of men who lived
in these climates. We may particularly mention the skull found in
the <i>tumulus</i> at Borreby in Denmark, which has been studied with
extreme care by Mr. Busk.</p>

<p>This skull (fig. 129) presents a somewhat remarkable similarity to
that of Neanderthal, of which we have spoken in a previous chapter.
The superciliary ridges are very prominent, the forehead is retiring,
the occiput is short and sloped forward. It might, therefore, find its
origin among the races of which the skulls of Neanderthal and
Borreby are the representatives and the relics, and the latter might
well be the descendants of the former.</p>

<div class="figcenter topspace2"><a name="i_237.jpg" id="i_237.jpg"></a>
<img src="images/i_237.jpg"
alt="Borreby Skull"  />
<div class="caption">Fig. 129.&mdash;The Borreby Skull.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">Anthropologists have had much discussion about the question, to
what particular human race of the present time may the skulls found
in the <i>tumulus</i> at Borreby be considered to be allied? But all these
discussions are deficient in those elements on which any serious and
definite argument might be founded. It would, therefore, be going
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"> [Pg 183]</a></span>
beyond our purpose should we reproduce them here. If, in the sketch
of the Borreby skull, we place, before the eyes of our readers the type
of the human cranium which existed during the period of the Stone
Age, our only object is to prove that the primitive Northerner resembles
the present race of man, both in the beauty and in the
regularity of the shape of his skull; also, in order once more to
recall to mind how false and trivial must the judgment be of those
short-sighted <i>savants</i> who would establish a genealogical filiation
between man and the ape.</p>

<p>As we stated in the Introduction to this volume, a mere glance cast
upon this skull is sufficient to bring to naught all that has been
written and propounded touching the organic consanguinity which
is asserted to exist between man and the ape, to say nothing of the
objects produced by primitive man&mdash;objects which, in this work, we
are studying in all necessary detail. An examination of the labours
of primitive man is the best means of proving&mdash;every other consideration
being set aside&mdash;that a great abyss exists between him and the
animal; this is the best argument against our pretended <i>simial</i> origin,
as it is called by those who seek to veil their absurd ideas under grand
scientific phrases.</p>

<div class="chapsum">Tombs and Mode of Interment during the Polished-stone Epoch&mdash;<i>Tumuli</i> and other
sepulchral Monuments formerly called <i>Celtic</i>&mdash;Labours of MM. Alexandre Bertrand
and Bonstetten&mdash;Funeral Customs.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> in our previous chapters described and delineated both the
weapons and instruments produced by the rudimentary manufacturing
skill of man during the polished-stone epoch; having also introduced
to notice the types of the human race during this period; we now
have to speak of their tombs, their mode of interment, and all the
facts connected with their funeral customs.</p>

<p>A fortunate and rather strange circumstance has both facilitated
and given a degree of certainty to the information and ideas we are
about to lay before our readers. The tombs of the men of the polished-stone
epoch&mdash;their funeral monuments&mdash;have been thoroughly studied,
described, and ransacked by archæologists and antiquarians, who for
many years past have made them the subject of a multitude of publications
and learned dissertations. In fact, these tombs are nothing
but the <i>dolmens</i>, or the so-called <i>Celtic</i> and <i>Druidical</i> monuments;
but they by no means belong, as has always been thought, to any
historical period, that is, to the times of the Celts, for they go back to
a much more remote antiquity&mdash;the pre-historic period of the polished-stone
age.</p>

<p>This explanatory <i>datum</i> having been taken into account, we shall
now study the <i>dolmens</i> and other so-called <i>megalithic</i> monuments&mdash;the
grand relics of an epoch buried in the night of time; those colossal
enigmas which impose upon our reason and excite to the very highest
pitch the curiosity of men of science.</p>

<p><i>Dolmens</i> are monuments composed of a great block or slab of rock,
more or less flat in their shape according to the country in which they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"> [Pg 185]</a></span>
are situate, placed horizontally on a certain number of stones which
are reared up perpendicularly to serve as its supports.</p>

<p class="topspace2">This kind of sepulchral chamber was usually covered by earth,
which formed a hillock over it. But in the course of time this earth
often disappeared, leaving nothing but the naked stones of the
sepulchral monument.</p>

<p class="topspace2">These are the bare stones which have been taken for <i>stone altars</i>,
being referred to the religious worship of the Gauls. The supposed
Druidical altars are, in fact, nothing but ruined <i>dolmens</i>. The purpose,
therefore, for which they were elevated was not, as has always been
stated, to serve as the scene of the sacrifices of a cruel religion; for,
at the present day, it is completely proved that the <i>dolmens</i> were the
tombs of a pre-historic epoch.</p>

<p>These tombs were intended to receive several dead bodies. The
corpses were placed in the chamber which was formed by the upper
slab and the supports. Some of these chambers had two stages or
stories, and then furnished a larger number of sepulchres.</p>

<p class="topspace2">Some <i>dolmens</i> are completely open to view, like that represented in
fig. 132, nothing impeding a perfect sight of them; others, on the
contrary, are covered with a hillock of earth, the dimensions of which
vary according to the size of the monument itself.</p>

<p>This latter kind of <i>dolmen</i> more specially assumes the nature of a
<i>tumulus</i>; a designation which conveys the idea of some mound raised
above the tomb.</p>

exhibited in the Museum of Saint-Germain. This model in relief has
a portion cut off it which, by means of a cord and pulley, can be
elevated or lowered at will, thus affording a view of the interior of the

<p class="topspace2">Were all these <i>dolmens</i> originally covered by earth? This is a
question which still remains unsolved. M. Alexandre Bertrand,
Director of the Archæological Museum of Saint-Germain, to whom we
owe some very remarkable works on the primitive monuments of
ancient Gaul, decides it in the affirmative; whilst M. de Bonstetten,
a Swiss archæologist of great merit, is of the contrary opinion. The
matter, however, is of no very great importance in itself. It is, at all
events, an unquestionable fact that certain <i>dolmens</i> which are now
uncovered were once buried; for they are noticed to stand in the
centre of slightly raised mounds in which the supports are deeply
buried. As we before stated, the action of time has destroyed the
covering which the pre-historic peoples placed over their sepulchres in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"> [Pg 188]</a></span>
order to defend them from the injuries of time and the profanation of
man. Thus, all that we now see is the bare stones of the sepulchral
chambers&mdash;for so long a time supposed to be altars, and ascribed to
the religious worship of the Gauls.</p>

<p class="topspace2">In considering, therefore, the <i>dolmens</i> of Brittany, which have been
so many times described by antiquarians and made to figure among
the number of our historical monuments, we must renounce the idea
of looking upon them as symbols of the religion of our ancestors.
They can now only be regarded as sepulchral chambers.</p>

<p class="topspace2"><i>Dolmens</i> are very numerous in France; much more numerous,
indeed, than is generally thought. It used to be the common idea
that they existed only in Brittany, and those curious in such matters
wondered at the supposed Druidical altars which were so plentifully
distributed in this ancient province of France. But Brittany is far
from possessing the exclusive privilege of these megalithic constructions.
They are found in fifty-eight of the French departments,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"> [Pg 189]</a></span>
belonging, for the most part, to the regions of the south and south-west.
The department of Finisterre contains 500 of them; Lot, 500;
Morbihan, 250; Ardèche, 155; Aveyron, 125; Dordogne, 100; &amp;c.

<p class="topspace2">The authors who have written on the question we are now considering,
especially Sir J. Lubbock in his work on 'Pre-historic Times,'
and Nilsson, the Swedish archæologist, have given a much too complicated
aspect to their descriptions of the tombs of pre-historic ages,
owing to their having multiplied the distinctions in this kind of monument.
We should only perplex our readers by following these authors
into all their divisions. We must, however, give some few details about
them.</p>

</div>

<p class="topspace2">Sir J. Lubbock gives the name of <i>passage grave</i>, to that which the
northern archæologists call <i>Ganggraben</i> (tomb with passages); of
these we have given four representations (figs. 136, 137, 138, 139),
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"> [Pg 190]</a></span>
all selected from specimens in France. This name is applied to a
passage leading to a more spacious chamber, round which the bodies
are ranged. The gallery, formed of enormous slabs of stone placed in
succession one after the other, almost always points towards the same
point of the compass; in the Scandinavian states, it generally has its
opening facing the south or east, never the north.</p>

<p>The same author gives the name of <i>chambered tumuli</i> (fig. 140)
to tombs which are composed either of a single chamber or of a
collection of large chambers, the roofs and walls of which are constructed
with stones of immense size, which are again covered up
by considerable masses of earth. This kind of tomb is found most
frequently in the countries of the north.</p>

<i>chambered tumulus</i>.</p>

<p class="topspace2">Before bringing to a close this description of megalithic monuments,
we must say a few words as to <i>menhirs</i> and <i>cromlechs</i>.</p>

<p><i>Menhirs</i> (fig. 141) are enormous blocks of rough stone which were
set up in the ground in the vicinity of tombs. They were set up
either separately, as represented in fig. 141, or in rows, that is, in a
circle or in an avenue.</p>

<p class="topspace2">There is in Brittany an extremely curious array of stones of this
kind; this is the range of <i>menhirs</i> of Carnac (fig. 142). The stones
are here distributed in eleven parallel lines, over a distance of 1100
yards, and, running along the sea-shore of Brittany, present a very
strange appearance.</p>

<p class="topspace2">When <i>menhirs</i> are arranged in circles, either single or several
together, they are called <i>cromlechs</i>. They are vast circuits of stones,
generally arranged round a <i>dolmen</i>. The respect which was considered
due to the dead appears to have converted these enclosures
into places of pilgrimage, where, on certain days, public assemblies
were held. These enclosures are sometimes circular, as in England,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"> [Pg 192]</a></span>
sometimes rectangular, as in Germany, and embrace one or more
ranks.</p>

<p class="topspace2">Among all these various monuments the "passage-tombs" and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"> [Pg 193]</a></span>
<i>tumuli</i> are the only ones which will come within the scope of this
work; for these only have furnished us with any relics of pre-historic
times, and have given us any information with respect to the peoples
who occupied a great part of Europe at a date far anterior to any
traditionary record.</p>

<p>These stone monuments, as we have already stated, are neither
Celtic nor Druidical. The Celts&mdash;a nation which occupied a portion
of Gaul at a period long before the Christian era&mdash;were altogether
innocent of any megalithic construction. They found these monuments
already in existence at the time of their immigration, and,
doubtless, looked upon them with as much astonishment as is shown
by observers of the present day. Whenever there appeared any advantage
in utilising them, the Celts did not fail to avail themselves
of them. The priests of this ancient people, the Druids, who plucked
from off the oak the sacred mistletoe, performed their religious ceremonies
in the depths of some obscure forest. Now, no <i>dolmen</i> was
ever built in the midst of a forest; all the stone monuments which
now exist stand in comparatively unwooded parts of the country.
We must, therefore, renounce the ancient and poetical idea which
recognised in these <i>dolmens</i> the sacrificial altars of the religion of our
ancestors.</p>

<p>Some <i>tumuli</i> attain proportions which are really colossal. Among
these is Silbury Hill, the largest in Great Britain, which is nearly
200 feet high. The enormous amount of labour which would be
involved in constructions of this kind has led to the idea that
they were not raised except in honour of chiefs and other great personages.</p>

<p>On consulting those records of history which extend back to the
most remote antiquity, we arrive at the fact that the custom of raising
colossal tombs to the illustrious dead was one that was much in vogue
in the ancient Eastern world. Traces of these monuments are found
among the Hebrews, the Assyrians, the Greeks, the Egyptians, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Thus Semiramis, Queen of Nineveh, raised a mound over the tomb
of Ninus, her husband. Stones were likewise piled up over the
remains of Laïus, father of &OElig;dipus. In the 'Iliad,' Homer speaks of
the mounds that were raised to the memory of Hector and Patroclus.
That dedicated to Patroclus&mdash;the pious work of Achilles&mdash;was more
than 100 feet in diameter. Homer speaks of the <i>tumuli</i> existing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"> [Pg 194]</a></span>
in Greece, which, even in his time, were considered very ancient,
and calls them the tombs of the heroes. A <i>tumulus</i> was raised by
Alexander the Great over the ashes of his friend Hephæstio, and so
great were the dimensions of this monument that it is said to have
cost 1200 talents, that is about £240,000 of our money. In Roman
history, too, we find instances of the same kind. Lastly, the pyramids
of Egypt, those costly and colossal funeral monuments, are the still
visible representations of the highest expression of posthumous homage
which was rendered by the generations of antiquity to their most
illustrious and mighty men.</p>

<p>This, however, could not have been in every case the prevailing
idea in the men of the Stone Age, in causing the construction of these
<i>tumuli</i>. The large number of bodies which have been found in some
of these monuments completely does away with the notion that they
were raised in honour of a single personage, or even of a single family.
They were often sepulchres or burial-places common to the use of all.
Among this class we must rank the <i>tumuli</i> of Axevalla and of Luttra,
situated not far from one another in Sweden. The first, which was
opened in 1805, contained twenty tombs of an almost cubical form,
each containing a skeleton in a crouching or contracted attitude.
When the second was opened, the explorers found themselves in the
presence of hundreds of skeletons placed in four rows one upon
another, all in a contracted position like those at Axevalla; along
with these human remains various relics of the Stone Age were also
discovered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"> [Pg 195]</a></span></p>
<p>M. Nilsson has propounded the opinion that the "passage-graves"
are nothing but former habitations, which had been converted into
tombs after the death of those who had previously occupied them.
When the master of the house had breathed his last&mdash;especially in
the case of some illustrious individual&mdash;his surviving friends used to
place near him various articles of food to provide for his long journey;
and also his weapons and other objects which were most precious to
him when in life; then the dwelling was closed up, and was only
reopened for the purpose of bearing in the remains of his spouse and
of his children.</p>

<p>Sir J. Lubbock shares in this opinion, and brings forward facts in
its favour. He recites the accounts of various travellers, according to
which, the winter-dwellings of certain people in the extreme north
bear a very marked resemblance to the "passage-tombs" of the Stone
Age. Of this kind are the habitations of the Siberians and the
Esquimaux, which are composed of an oval or circular chamber placed
a little under the surface of the ground, and completely covered with
earth. Sir J. Lubbock thinks, therefore, that in many cases habitations
of this kind may have been taken for <i>tumuli</i>&mdash;a mistake, he
adds, all the more likely to be made because some of these mounds,
although containing ashes, remains of pottery, and various implements,
have not furnished any relics of human bones.</p>

<p>In his work on the 'Sépultures de l'Age de la Pierre chez les
Parisii,' M. Leguay, a learned architect and member of the Archælogical
Society, has called attention to the fact that the construction
of these <i>dolmens</i> betrays, as existing in the men of this epoch, a
somewhat advanced degree of knowledge of the elements of architecture:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The interment of the dead," says M. Leguay, "took place, during
the polished-stone epoch, in vaults, or a kind of tomb constructed on
the spot, of stones of various thicknesses, generally flat in shape, and
not elevated to any very great height, being laid without any kind of
cement or mortar. These vaults, which were at first undivided, were
subsequently separated into compartments by stones of a similar
character, in which compartments bodies were placed in various positions.
They were covered with earth or with flat stones, and sometimes
we meet with a circular eminence raised over them, formed of a
considerable heap of stones which had been subsequently brought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"> [Pg 196]</a></span>
thither; this fact was verified by M. Brouillet in 1862 at the <i>Tombelle
de Brioux</i> (Vienne).</p>

<p>"This kind of interment bears evidence of some real progress.
Polished flint instruments are met with intermingled with worked
stones which have been brought from a distance. Pottery of a very
significant character approaches that of the epoch at which ornamentation
commenced; and the <i>Tombelle de Brioux</i> has furnished two
vessels with projecting and perforated handles formed in the clay
itself. I met with specimens similar to these both in shape and workmanship
in the cremation-tombs at Villeneuve-Saint-Georges, which,
as I have previously stated, appeared to me to be later in date than
the simple interment situated below them.</p>

<p>"The first element in the art of construction, that is, stability, is
manifested in these latter monuments. They do not come up to the
fine <i>dolmens</i>, or to the monuments which followed them, but the
principle on which stones should be laid together is already arrived
at. The slab forming the covering is the first attempt at the lintel,
the primitive base of architectural science. By insensible degrees the
dimensions of the monument increased, the nature of the materials
were modified, and, from the small elementary monument to the grand
sepulchral <i>dolmen</i>, but one step remained to be made&mdash;a giant step,
certainly, but not beyond the reach of human intelligence.</p>

<p>"This step, however, was not accomplished suddenly and without
transitional stages. We find a proof of this in the beautiful ossuary discovered
in 1863, at Chamant near Senlis (Oise), on the property of
the Comte de Lavaulx. This monument does not yet come up to the
most beautiful of the class; but it possesses all the inspirations
which suggested the form of its successors, of which, indeed, it is
the type.</p>

<p>"Almost flat slabs of stone, of a greater height than those forming
the vaults, and of rather considerable dimensions, are placed on edge
so as to form a square chamber. A partition, formed of stones of a
similar character, leaving a space or passage between them, separates
the chamber into two unequal portions. Some arrangement of this
kind has been observed in most of the finest <i>dolmens</i>; it is found at a
spot not far from Chamant, in a covered way known under the name
of the <i>Pierres Turquoises</i>, in the forest of Carnelle, near Beaumont-sur-Oise
(Seine-et-Oise).</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"> [Pg 197]</a></span></p>
<p>"At Chamant, however, the chamber was not more than 3 to
4 feet in height under the roof, which was formed of large flat
stones, and was large enough to allow of a considerable number of
bodies to be deposited within it, either in a recumbent or contracted
position. Near them there were placed delicately-wrought flints, and
also some fine-polished hatchets, one of which was of serpentine;
another of large dimensions, sculptured after the fashion of the
diluvial hatchets, appeared to me to have been prepared for polishing.</p>

<p>"The researches which have been made have brought to light but
slight traces of pottery, and the small fragments that I have examined
do not point out any very remote age for this monument. Nevertheless,
the investigation of this sepulchre, in which I was guided by a
somewhat different idea from that of merely studying the monument
itself, was not carried out with the exact care that would be necessary
for collecting all the indications which it might have furnished.</p>

<p>"Between the sepulchre of Chamant and the finest <i>dolmens</i>, the
distinction is nothing more than a question of dimensions rather than
any chronological point. The latter are formed of colossal stones,
and when one examines them and seeks to realise the process which
must have been employed for raising them, the mind is utterly perplexed,
and the imagination finds a difficulty in conceiving how it
was possible to move these immense masses, and, especially, to place
them in the positions they now occupy; for at the present day, in
order to arrive at similar results, it would be necessary to employ all
the means which science has at command."<a name="fnanchor_27"
id="fnanchor_27"></a><a href="#footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The megalithic constructions do not all date back to the same
epoch. Some were raised during the Stone Age, others during the
Bronze Age. There is nothing in their mode of architecture which
will enable us to recognise their degree of antiquity; but the relics
which they contain afford us complete information in this respect.
Thus, in France, according to M. Alexandre Bertrand, the <i>dolmens</i>
and the <i>tumuli-dolmens</i> contain, in a general way, nothing but stone
and bone articles; those of bronze and gold are very rare, and iron is
never met with. In the <i>true tumuli</i>, on the contrary, bronze
objects predominate, and iron is very abundant; this is an evident
proof that these monuments are of less ancient origin than the
<i>dolmens</i>. In the same way we ascertain that the Danish <i>dolmens</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"> [Pg 198]</a></span>
and the great sepulchral chambers of Scandinavia, all belong to the
polished-stone epoch. When, therefore, we class the <i>dolmens</i> in this
last-named epoch of man's history, we are deciding in full harmony
with the great body of <i>data</i> which bear upon the point.</p>

<p>In order to fix the period with still greater accuracy, we might add
that the <i>dolmens</i> belong to the latter portion of the polished-stone
epoch and the commencement of the bronze age. But, as we before
said, we do not attach any importance to these distinctions, which
would only uselessly embarrass the mind of the reader.</p>

<p>An examination of the Danish <i>dolmens</i> has led the author of the
'Catalogue of Pre-historic Objects sent by Denmark to the Universal
Exposition of 1867,' to sum up in the following words the details
concerning these sepulchral monuments:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As regards the Danish <i>dolmens</i>, the number of skeletons contained
in them varies much; in the largest, there are as many as
twenty, and in the smallest there are not more than five or six;
sometimes they are placed in stages one above the other.</p>

<p>"The bones are never found in natural order; the head lies close
to the knees, and no limb is in its natural place. It follows from
this, that in the course of interment the body was contracted into a
crouching position.</p>

<p>"The bottom of the sepulchral chamber of a <i>dolmen</i> is generally
covered with a layer of flints which have been subjected to fire; this
is the floor on which the body was deposited; it was then covered
with a thin coating of earth, and the tomb was closed. Yet, as we
have just observed, it was but very rarely that <i>dolmens</i> contained
only one skeleton. They must, therefore, have been opened afresh in
order to deposit other bodies. It must have been on these occasions,
in order to contend with the miasma of putrefaction, that they lighted
the fires, of which numerous and evident traces are seen inside the
<i>dolmens</i>. This course of action continued, as it appears, until the
time when the <i>dolmen</i> was entirely filled up: but even then, the
tomb does not, in every case, seem to have been abandoned. Sometimes
the most ancient skeletons have been displaced to make room
for fresh bodies. This had taken place in a <i>dolmen</i> near Copenhagen,
which was opened and searched in the presence of the late King
Frederick VII.</p>

<p>"A <i>dolmen</i> situated near the village of Hammer, opened a few
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"> [Pg 199]</a></span>
years ago by M. Boye, presented some very curious peculiarities. In
addition to flint instruments, human bones were discovered, which
had also been subjected to the action of fire. We are, therefore, led
to suppose, that a funeral banquet had taken place in the vicinity of
the tomb, and that some joints of human flesh had formed an addition
to the roasted stag. This is, however, the only discovery of the
kind which has been made up to the present time, and we should by
no means be justified in drawing the inference that the inhabitants of
Denmark at this epoch were addicted to cannibalism.</p>

<p>"The dead bodies were deposited along with their weapons and
implements, and also with certain vessels which must have contained
the food which perhaps some religious usage induced them to leave
close to the body. For a long time it was supposed that it was the
custom to place these weapons by the side of <i>men</i> only. But in a
<i>dolmen</i> at Gieruen, a hatchet was found near a skeleton which was
evidently that of a woman.</p>

<p>"We now give the inventory of a 'find' made in a Danish <i>dolmen</i>,
that of Hielm, in the Isle of Moen, which was opened in 1853. The
sepulchral chamber was 16&frac12; feet in length, 11&frac12; feet in width, and
4&frac12; feet in height.</p>

<p>"In it were discovered twenty-two spear-heads, the largest of
which was 11 inches in length, and the smallest 5&frac12; inches; more
than forty flint flakes or knives from 2 to 5 inches in length;
three flat hatchets, and one rather thicker; three carpenter's chisels,
the longest of which measured 8 inches; a finely-made hammer 5
inches long; three flint nuclei exactly similar to those found in
the kitchen-middens; and lastly, in addition to all these flint articles,
some amber beads and forty earthen vessels moulded by the hand."
<a name="fnanchor_28"
id="fnanchor_28"></a><a href="#footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>What were the funeral customs in use among men during the
polished-stone epoch? and what were the ceremonies which took
place at that period when they buried their dead? These are questions
which it will not be difficult to answer after a due investigation
of the <i>dolmens</i> and <i>tumuli</i>.</p>

<p>In a great number of <i>tumuli</i>, animal bones have been found either
broken or notched by sharp instruments. This is an indication that
the funeral rites were accompanied by feasts just as in the preceding
epochs.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"> [Pg 200]</a></span></p>
<p>The body which was about to be enclosed in the <i>tumulus</i> was
borne upon boughs of trees, as is the case among some savage tribes
of the present day. The men and women attending wore their best
attire; necklaces of amber and shells adorned their necks. Men
carrying torches walked in front of the procession, in order to guide
the bearers into the dark recesses of the sepulchral chambers.</p>

<p>From these data fig. 146 has been designed, which gives a representation
of <i>a funeral ceremony during the polished-stone epoch</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter topspace2"><a name="i_256.jpg" id="i_256.jpg"></a>

<div class="caption">Fig. 146.&mdash;A <i>Tumulus</i> of the
Polished-stone Epoch.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">If we may judge by the calcined human bones which are rather
frequently met with in tombs, there is reason to believe that sometimes
victims were sacrificed over the body of the defunct, perhaps
slaves, perhaps even his widow&mdash;the custom of sacrificing the widow
still being in practice in certain parts of India.</p>

<p>Sir J. Lubbock is, besides, of opinion that when a woman died in
giving birth to a child, or even whilst she was still suckling it, the
child was interred alive with her. This hypothesis appears a natural
one, when we take into account the great number of cases in which
the skeletons of a woman and child have been found together.</p>

<p>M. Leguay in his 'Mémoire sur les Sépultures des Parisii,' which
we quoted above, expresses the opinion that after each interment,
in addition to the funeral banquet, a fire was lighted on the mound
above the <i>tumulus</i>, and that each attendant threw certain precious
objects into the flames.</p>

<p>The objects which were most precious during the polished-stone
epoch were flints wrought into hatchets, poniards, or knives.</p>

<p>"On to this burning hearth," says M. Leguay, "as numerous
instances prove, those who were present were in the habit of casting
stones, or more generally wrought flints, utensils and instruments, all
made either of some kind of stone or of bone; also fragments of
pottery, and, doubtless, other objects which the fire has destroyed.</p>

<p>"There are many of these objects which have not suffered any
injury from the fire; some of the flints, indeed, seem so freshly cut
and are so little altered by the lapse of time, that it might be readily
imagined that they had been but recently wrought; these were not
placed in the sepulchre, but are met with intermingled with the
earth which covers or surrounds the hearth, and appear in many cases
to have been cast in after the extinction of the fire as the earth was
being filled in.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"> [Pg 201]</a></span></p>
<p>"Sometimes, indeed, when the archæologist devotes especial care to
his digging, he comes across a kind of layer of wrought flints which
are, in fact, to be looked upon as refuse rather than wrought
articles. Their position appears to indicate the surface of the soil
during that epoch, a surface which has been covered up by the successive
deposits of subsequent ages; and although some of these
flakes may have been due to some of the objects which had been
placed in the sepulchre having been chipped on the spot, there are
many others which have not originated in this way, and have come
from objects which have been deposited in other places.</p>

<p>"All these stones, which are common to three kinds of burial-places,
have fulfilled, in my opinion, a votive function; that is to say,
that they represent, as regards this epoch, the wreaths and coronals of
<i>immortelles</i>, or the other objects which we in the present day place
upon the tombs of our relations or friends; thus following out a
custom the origin of which is lost in the night of time.</p>

<p>"And let not the reader treat with ridicule these ideas, which I
hold to be not far from the truth. Men, as individuals, may pass
away, and generations may disappear; but they always hand down to
their progeny and those that succeed them the customs of their epoch;
which customs will undergo little or no change until the causes which
have produced them also disappear. Thus it is with all that concerns
the ceremonies observed in bearing man to his last resting-place&mdash;a
duty which can never change, and always brings with it its train
of sorrow and regret. Nowadays, a small sum of money is sufficient
to give outward expression to our grief; but at these remote epochs
each individual fashioned his own offering, chipped his own flint, and
bore it himself to the grave of his friend.</p>

<p>"This idea will explain the diversity of shape in the flints placed
round and in the sepulchres, and especially the uncouthness of many
of the articles which, although all manufactured of the same material,
betray a style of workmanship exercised by numerous hands more
or less practised in the work.</p>

<p>"It may, however, be readily conceived that during an epoch when
stones were the chief material for all useful implements, every wrought
flint represented a certain value. To deprive themselves of these
objects of value in order to offer them to the manes of the dead was
considered a laudable action, just as was the case subsequently as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"> [Pg 202]</a></span>
regards still more precious objects; and this custom, which was
observed during many long ages, although sometimes and perhaps
often practised with the declining energy inherent in every religious
custom, was the origin of a practice adopted by many of the nations
of antiquity, that, namely, of casting a stone upon the tomb of the
dead. Thus were formed those sepulchral heaps of stones called
<i>gal-gals</i>, some of which still exist.</p>

<p>"It is, without doubt, to this votive idea that we must attribute
the fact that so many beautiful objects which ornament our museums
have been found deposited in these sepulchres; but we must remark
that the large and roughly-hewn hatchets, and also the knives of the
second epoch, are replaced, in the third epoch, by polished hatchets
often even fitted with handles, and also by knives of much larger size
and finer workmanship.</p>

<p>"As an additional corroboration of my ideas, I will mention a
curious fact which I ascertained to exist in two sepulchres of this
kind which I searched; the significance of this fact can only be explained
by a hypothesis which any one may readily develop.</p>

<p>"Each of them contained one long polished hatchet, broken in two
in the middle; the other portion of which was not found in the
sepulchre.</p>

<p>"One is now in the Museum at Cluny, where I deposited it; the
other is still in my own possession. It is beyond all dispute that they
were thus broken at the time of the interment.</p>

<p>"Numerous hatchets broken in a similar way have been found by
M. A. Forgeais in the bed of the Seine at Paris, and also in various
other spots; all of them were broken in the middle, and I have always
been of opinion that they proceeded from sepulchres of a like kind,
which, having been placed on the edge of the river, had been washed
away by the flow of water which during long ages had eaten away
the banks."</p>

<p>At a subsequent period, that is, during the bronze epoch, dead
bodies were often, as we shall see, reduced to ashes either wholly or
in part, and the ashes were enclosed in urns.</p>

<div class="chapsum">The Discovery of Metals&mdash;Various Reasons suggested for explaining the Origin of
Bronze in the West&mdash;The Invention of Bronze&mdash;A Foundry during the Bronze
Epoch&mdash;Permanent and Itinerant Foundries existing during the Bronze Epoch&mdash;Did
the knowledge of Metals take its rise in Europe owing to the Progress of
Civilisation, or was it a Foreign Importation?</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> acquisition and employment of metals is one of the greatest facts
in our social history. Thenard, the chemist, has asserted that we
may judge of the state of civilisation of any nation by the degree of
perfection at which it has arrived in the workmanship of iron. Looking
at the matter in a more general point of view, we may safely say
that if man had never become acquainted with metals he would have
remained for ever in his originally savage state.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the free use of, or privation from,
metals is a question of life and death for any nation. When we take
into account the important part that is played by metals in all modern
communities, we cannot fail to be convinced that, without metals
civilisation would have been impossible. That astonishing scientific
and industrial movement which this nineteenth century presents to
us in its most remarkable form&mdash;the material comfort which existing
generations are enjoying&mdash;all our mechanical appliances, manufactures
of such diverse kinds, books and arts&mdash;not one of all these benefits for
man, in the absence of metals, could ever have come into existence.
Without the help of metal, man would have been condemned to
live in great discomfort; but, aided by this irresistible lever, his
powers have been increased a hundredfold, and man's empire has
been gradually extended over the whole of nature.</p>

<p>In all probability, gold, among all the metals, is the first with
which man became acquainted. Gold, in a metallic state, is drifted
down by the waters of many a river, and its glittering brightness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"> [Pg 206]</a></span>
would naturally point it out to primitive peoples. Savages are like
children; they love everything that shines brightly. Gold, therefore,
must, in very early days, have found its way into the possession of the
primitive inhabitants of our globe.</p>

<p>Gold is still often met with in the Ural mountains; and thence,
perhaps, it originally spread all over the north of Europe. The
streams and the rivers of some of the central countries of Europe,
such as Switzerland, France, and Germany, might also have furnished
a small quantity.</p>

<p>After gold, copper must have been the next metal which attracted
the attention of men; in the first place, because this metal is sometimes
found in a native state, and also because cupriferous ores, and
especially copper pyrites, are very widely distributed. Nevertheless,
the extraction of copper from the ores is an operation of such a
delicate character, that it must have been beyond the reach of the
metallurgic appliances at the disposal of men during the early pre-historic
period.</p>

<p>The knowledge of tin also dates back to a very high antiquity.
Still, although men might become acquainted with tin ores, a long
interval must have elapsed before they could have succeeded in
extracting the pure metal.</p>

<p>Silver did not become known to men until a much later date; for
this metal is very seldom met with in the <i>tumuli</i> of the bronze epoch.
The fact is, that silver is seldom found in a pure state, and scarcely
ever except in combination with lead ores; lead, however, was not
known until after iron.</p>

<p>Bronze, as every one knows, is an alloy of copper and tin (nine
parts of copper and one of tin). Now it is precisely this alloy,
namely bronze, which was the first metallic substance used in Europe;
indeed the sole substance used, to the exclusion of copper. We have,
therefore, to explain the somewhat singular circumstance that an
alloy and not a pure metal was the metallic substance that was
earliest used in Europe; and we must also inquire how it was that
bronze could have been composed by the nations which succeeded
those of the polished-stone epoch.</p>

<p>At first sight, it might appear strange that an alloy like bronze
should have been the first metallic substance used by man, thus
setting aside iron, deposits of which are very plentiful in Europe.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"> [Pg 207]</a></span>
But it is to be remarked, in the first place, that iron ores do not
attract the attention so much as those of tin and copper. Added to
this, the extraction of iron from its ores is one of the most difficult
operations of the kind. When dealing with ferruginous ores, the
first operation produces nothing more than rough cast iron&mdash;a very
impure substance, which is so short and brittle that it possesses
scarcely any metallic qualities, and differs but little from stone as
regards any use it could be applied to. It requires re-heating and
hammering to bring it into the condition of malleable iron. On the
other hand, by simply smelting together copper and tin ores and
adding a little charcoal, bronze might be at once produced, without
any necessity for previously extracting and obtaining pure copper
and tin in a separate state. This will explain how it came to pass
that the earliest metal-workers produced bronze at one operation,
without even being acquainted with the separate metals which enter
into its composition.</p>

<p>We are left entirely to hypothesis in endeavouring to realise to
ourselves how men were led to mix together copper and tin ores, and
thus to produce bronze&mdash;a hard, durable and fusible alloy, and consequently
well adapted, without much trouble, for the fabrication, by
melting in moulds, of hatchets, poniards, and swords, as well as agricultural
and mechanical instruments.</p>

<p>Bronze was endowed with all the most admirable qualities for
aiding the nascent industrial skill of mankind. It is more fusible
than copper and is also harder than this metal; indeed, in the latter
respect, it may compete with iron. It is a curious fact that bronze
has the peculiarity of hardening when cooled gradually. If it is
made red-hot in the fire and is then suddenly cooled by plunging
it into water, the metal becomes more ductile and may be easily
hammered; but it regains its original hardness if it is again heated
red-hot and then allowed to cool slowly. This, as we see, is just the
contrary to the properties of steel.</p>

<p>By taking advantage of this quality of bronze they were enabled
to hammer it, and, after the necessary work with the hammer was
finished, they could, by means of gradual cooling, restore the metal
to its original hardness. At the present day, cymbals and tom-toms
are made exactly in this way.</p>

<p>All these considerations will perhaps sufficiently explain to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"> [Pg 208]</a></span>
reader why the use of bronze preceded that of iron among all the
European and Asiatic peoples.</p>

<p>On this quasi-absence of manufactured copper in the pre-historic
monuments of Europe, certain archæologists have relied when propounding
the opinion that bronze was brought into Europe by a
people coming from the East, a more advanced and civilised people,
who had already passed through their <i>copper age</i>, that is, had known
and made use of pure copper. This people, it is said, violently
invaded Europe, and in almost every district took the place of the
primitive population; so that, in every country, bronze suddenly
succeeded stone for the manufacture of instruments, weapons and
implements.</p>

<p>By the side of these <i>savants</i>, who represent to some extent, in
ethnological questions, the partisans of the great geological cataclysms
or revolutions of the globe, there are others who would refer the
appearance of bronze in Europe to a great extension of commercial
relations. They utterly reject the idea of any conquest, of any great
invasion having brought with it a complete change in manners,
customs, and processes of industrial skill. In their opinion, it was
commerce which first brought bronze from the East and introduced
it to the men of the West. This is the view of Sir Cornewall
Lewis, the archæologist and statesman, and also of Prof. Nilsson,
who attributes to the Ph&#339;nicians the importation of bronze into
Europe.</p>

<p>Without attaining any great result, Nilsson has taken much trouble
in supporting this idea by acceptable proofs. We are called
upon to agree with the Danish archæologist in admitting that the
Ph&#339;nicians, that is, the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon went <i>with
their ships</i> to procure tin from Great Britain, in order to make an
alloy with it in their own country, which alloy they subsequently
imported into Europe.</p>

<p>This is nothing but historic fancy. To this romance of archæology
we shall oppose the simple explanation which chemistry suggests to
us. Our belief is that the bronze was fabricated on the spot by the
very people who made use of it. All that was requisite in order to
obtain bronze, was to mix and smelt together the ores of oxidised
copper or copper pyrites, and tin ore, adding a small quantity of
charcoal. Now, copper ore abounds in Europe; that of tin is certainly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"> [Pg 209]</a></span>
rare; and it is this rarity of tin ore which is appealed to in support
of the conjecture against which we are contending. But, although
tin ores are nowadays rare in Europe, except in England and
Saxony, they are, nevertheless, to be met with in the centre and south
of the Continent; and, doubtless, in the early ages of mankind the
quantities were quite sufficient to supply the slender requirements of
the dawning efforts of industrial skill. We may, perhaps, be permitted
to allege that the cause of the supplies of tin ores being so
poor in the centre and south of Europe, may be the fact that they
were exhausted by the workings of our ancestors. Thus, at least,
many of the deposits of copper, silver, and lead, have been exhausted
by the Romans, and we now find nothing more than the mere remains
of mines which were once very productive.</p>

<p>We may easily see that, in order to account for the presence of
bronze in Europe during the primitive epochs of mankind, it was not
necessary to build up such a framework of hypothesis as Prof. Nilsson
has so elaborately raised.</p>

<p>To sum up the whole matter, we may say that the use of bronze
preceded that of iron in the primitive industry of Europe and Asia;
and that the people of our hemisphere were acquainted with bronze
before they came to the knowledge of pure copper and tin; this is all
that we can safely assert on the point.</p>

<p>It might of course have been the case that copper and tin were
first used alone, and that the idea was subsequently entertained of
combining the two metals so as to improve both. But the facts
evidently show that, so far as regards Europe, things did not take
place in this way, and that bronze was employed in the works of
primitive industry before copper and tin were known as existing in a
separate state.<a name="fnanchor_29"
id="fnanchor_29"></a><a href="#footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>We must, however, state that in the New World the matter was
different. The Indians of North America, long before they knew
anything about bronze, were in the habit of hammering the copper
which was procured from the mines of Lake Superior, and of making
of it weapons, ornaments and implements.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"> [Pg 210]</a></span></p>
<p>After considering these general and theoretical points, we shall now
pass on to the history of the employment of bronze among men of
pre-historic ages, and shall endeavour to give some description of their
works for the manufacture of metals.</p>

<p>Facts handed down by tradition evidently show that, among the
peoples both of Europe and Asia, the use of bronze preceded that of iron.</p>

<p>Homer tells us that the soldiers of the Greek and Trojan armies
were provided with iron weapons, yet he reserves for the heroes
weapons made of bronze. It seems that bronze being the most
ancient, was therefore looked upon as the more noble metal; hence,
its use is reserved for chiefs or great warriors. Among all nations,
that which is the most ancient is ever the most honourable and the
most sacred. Thus, to mention one instance only, the Jews of our
own times still perform the ceremony of circumcision with a knife
made of stone. In this case, the stone-knife is an object consecrated by
religion, because the antiquity of this instrument is actually lost in
the night of time.</p>

<p>Bronze (or brass) is often mentioned in the Book of Genesis. Tubal-cain,
the first metal-worker of the Scriptures, who forged iron for all
kinds of purposes, also wrought in bronze (or brass). This alloy was
devoted to the production of objects of ornament.</p>

<p>We read in the First Book of Kings (vii. 13, 14), "And King
Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. He was a widow's
son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker
in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning
to work all works in <i>brass</i>."</p>

<p>The word <i>brass</i> must be here understood as being synonymous with
bronze, and certainly the Hebrew term had this signification.</p>

<p>As a specially remarkable object of bronze work, we may mention the
"sea of brass" of the Hebrews, which contained 3000 measures of water.</p>

<p>Herodotus<a name="fnanchor_30"
id="fnanchor_30"></a><a href="#footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> speaks of another colossal basin made of bronze, which
was sixty times the size of that which Pausanias, son of Cleobrontos,
presented to the temple of Jupiter Orios, a temple which had been
built near the Euxine, on the borders of Scythia. Its capacity was
six hundred <i>amphoræ</i>, and it was six "fingers" in thickness. The
Greeks used to employ these enormous basins in their religious ceremonies.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"> [Pg 211]</a></span></p>
<p>In Sweden and Norway, large receptacles of a similar kind were in
primitive ages employed in sacrificial ceremonies; they used to receive
the blood which flowed from the slaughtered animals.</p>

<p>In order to produce objects of this magnitude it was of course
necessary to have at disposal large foundries of bronze. These
foundries, which existed during historic periods, were preceded by
others of less importance used during the pre-historic epochs which
we are considering, that is, during the bronze epoch.</p>

<p>Vestiges of these ancient foundries have been discovered in Switzerland,
at Devaine, near Thonon, and at Walflinger, near Wintherthur;
especially also at Echallens, where objects have been found which
evidently originated from the working of some pre-historic foundry.</p>

<p>At Morges, in Switzerland, a stone mould has been discovered,
intended for casting hatchets. By running bronze into this ancient
mould, a hatchet has been made exactly similar to some of those in our
collections.</p>

<p>The casting was also effected in moulds of sand, which is the more
usual and more easy plan.</p>

<p>From these <i>data</i>, it is possible to imagine what sort of place a
foundry must have been during the bronze epoch.</p>

<p>In the production of bronze, they used to mix oxydated tin ore, in
the proportions which experience had taught them, with oxydated
copper ore or copper pyrites; to this mixture was added a small
quantity of charcoal. The whole was placed in an earthen vessel in
the midst of a burning furnace. The two oxides were reduced to a
metallic state by means of the charcoal; the copper and tin being set
free, blended and formed bronze.</p>

<p>When the alloy was obtained, all that was necessary was to dip it
out and pour it into sand or stone moulds which had been previously
arranged for the purpose.</p>

<p>The art of casting in bronze must have played a very essential part
among primitive peoples. There was no instrument that they used
which could not be made by casting it in bronze. The sword-blades
were thus made; and, in order to harden the edge of the weapon, it
was first heated and then cooled suddenly, being afterwards hammered
with a stone hammer.</p>

<p>In fig. 147, we represent the workshop of a caster in bronze during
the epoch we are considering. The alloy, having been previously
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"> [Pg 212]</a></span>
mixed, has been smelted in a furnace, and a workman is pouring it
into a sand-mould. Another man is examining a sword-blade which
has just been cast.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 147.&mdash;A Founder's Workshop during the Bronze Epoch.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">Bronze being precious, it is probable that in these ancient communities
bronze weapons and implements were reserved for rich and
powerful personages, and that stone weapons remained the attribute of
the common people. The use of bronze could only become general
after the lapse of time.</p>

<p>The high value of bronze would lead to its being economised as
much as possible. The Pre-historic Museum at Copenhagen contains
unquestionable proofs of this scarcity of the metal, and the means
which were used for obviating it. Among the bronze hatchets in the
Museum of Copenhagen, there are some which could only have served
as ornaments, for they contained a nucleus of clay, and the metal of
which they were composed was not thicker than a sheet of paper.</p>

<p>We must also add that worn-out instruments of bronze and utensils
which were out of use were carefully preserved in order to be re-cast;
the same material re-appearing in various forms and shapes.</p>

<p>We have just given a representation of the <i>workshop of a founder
of bronze</i>; but we must also state that in addition to these fixed
establishments there must have existed, at the epoch of which we are
speaking, certain itinerant founders who travelled about, carrying all
their necessary utensils on their backs, and offered their services
wherever they were required.</p>

<p>Every one is acquainted with the travelling-tinkers who, at the
present day, make their way down from the mountains of Auvergne,
the Black Forest, the Alps, or the Cévennes, and are called <i>péirerous</i>
and <i>estama-brazaïres</i> in the south of France, and <i>épingliers</i> in other
districts. These men are in the habit of working at separate jobs in
the villages and even in the public places of the towns. Of course
they travel with no more of the utensils of their craft than strict
necessity requires; but, nevertheless, what they carry is sufficient for
every purpose. A hollow made in the ground is the furnace in which
they place the nozzle of their portable bellows, and they hammer the
iron on a small anvil fixed in the earth.</p>

<p>Aided by these merely rudimentary means they execute pieces of
metal-work, the dimensions of which are really surprising. They make
nails and tacks, and even worm screws, repair locks, clean clocks, make
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"> [Pg 213]</a></span>
knives, mend skimmers, and restore umbrella-frames. They make
bronze rings out of republican <i>décimes</i>, and sell these popular trinkets
to the village beauties.</p>

<p>Incomparable in their line of business, these men are unequalled in
patching or re-tinning vessels made of tin and wrought or sheet-iron.
The mending of crockeryware also forms one of their numerous
vocations; and the repairing of a broken plate by means of an iron
rivet is mere play-work for their dexterous fingers. But melting down
and re-casting&mdash;these are the real triumphs of their art. The village
housewife brings to them her worn-out pewter vessel, and soon sees it
reappear as a new, brilliant, and polished utensil. Lamps, cans, covers,
and tin-plates and dishes are thus made to reappear in all their primitive
brightness.</p>

<p>The fusion and casting of bronze does not perplex them any more
than working in tin. They are in the habit of casting various utensils
in brass or bronze, such as candlesticks, bells, brackets, &amp;c. The
crucible which they use in melting brass is nothing but a hole dug in
the earth and filled up with burning charcoal, the fire being kept up
with the help of their bellows, the nozzle of which is lengthened so as
to open into the middle of the charcoal. On this furnace they place
their portable crucible, which is a kind of earthen ladle provided with
a handle.</p>

<p>Their system of casting is simple in the extreme. The pressed
sand, which serves them for a mould, is procured from the ditch at
the side of the road. Into this mould they pour the alloy out of the
very crucible in which it has been melted.</p>

<p>These itinerant metallurgists, these <i>estama-brazaïres</i>, who may be
noticed working in the villages of Lower Languedoc, whose ways
we have just depicted (not without some degree of pleasant reminiscence),
are nothing but the descendants of the travelling metal-workers
of the pre-historic bronze epoch. In addition to the permanent
establishment of this kind&mdash;the foundries, the remains of which have
been found in Switzerland, the French Jura, Germany and Denmark,
there certainly existed at that time certain workmen who travelled
about singly, from place to place, exercising their trade. Their stock
of tools, like the objects which they had to make or repair, was of a
very simple character; the sand from the wayside formed their moulds,
and their fuel was the dry wood of the forest.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"> [Pg 214]</a></span></p>
<p>The existence, at this remote epoch in the history of mankind, of
the itinerant workers in metal is proved by the fact, that practitioners
of this kind were known in the earliest <i>historic</i> periods who had
already to some extent become proficients in the art. Moses, the
Hebrew lawgiver, was able in the wilderness to make a brazen
serpent, the sight of which healed the Israelites who had been bitten
by venomous snakes; and, during the retirement of the prophet to
Mount Sinai, Aaron seemed to find no difficulty in casting the golden
calf, which was required of him by the murmurs of the people.
Itinerant founders must therefore have accompanied the Jewish army.</p>

<p>We have been compelled to dwell to some extent on the general
considerations which bear upon the introduction of bronze among the
ancient inhabitants of Europe who succeeded the men of the Stone
Age. In the chapters which follow we intend as far as possible to
trace out the picture of that period of man's history, which is called
<i>the Bronze Epoch</i>, and constitutes the first division of <i>the Age of
Metals</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> endeavouring to trace out the early history of the human race we
naturally turn our attention to all the means of investigation which
either study or chance have placed at our disposal. Grottos and
caves, the rock-shelters, the ancient camps, the centres of flint-working,
the Scandinavian kitchen-middens, the <i>dolmens</i>, and the <i>tumuli</i>&mdash;all
have lent their aid in affording those elements for the representation
of the earliest epoch of the history of primitive man which we have
already considered. The data which we shall resort to for delineating
the bronze epoch will be of a different kind.</p>

<p>Among all the sources of authentic information as to the manners
and customs of man in his earliest existence, none, certainly, are
more curious than those ancient remains which have lately been
brought to light and explored, and have received the name of

<p>The question may be asked, what are these <i>lacustrine dwellings</i>,
and in what way do they serve to elucidate the history of the bronze
epoch? These are just the points which we are about to explain.</p>

<p>The most important discoveries have often depended on very slight
causes. This assertion, although it has been made common by
frequent repetition, is none the less perfectly correct. To what do
we owe the knowledge of a multitude of curious details as to pre-historic
peoples? To an accidental and unusual depression of the
temperature in Switzerland. But we will explain.</p>

<p>The winter of 1853-1854 was, in Switzerland, so dry and cold
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"> [Pg 216]</a></span>
that the waters of the lakes fell far below their ordinary level. The
inhabitants of Meilen, a place situated on the banks of the Lake of
Zurich, took advantage of this circumstance, and gained from the
lake a tract of ground, which they set to work to raise and surround
with banks.</p>

<p>In carrying out these works they found in the mud at the bottom
of the lake a number of piles, some thrown down and others still
upright, fragments of rough pottery, bone and stone instruments,
and various other relics similar to those found in the Danish peat-bogs.</p>

<p>This extraordinary accumulation of objects of all kinds on the dried
bed of the lake appeared altogether inexplicable, and every one was at
fault in their remarks; but Dr. Keller of Zurich, having examined
the objects, at once came to a right understanding as to their signification.
It was evident to him that they belonged to pre-historic
times. By an association of ideas which no one had previously dreamt
of, he perceived that a relation existed between the piles and the other
relics discovered in the vicinity, and saw clearly that both dated back
to the same epoch. He thus came to the conclusion, that the ancient
inhabitants of the Lake of Zurich were in the habit of constructing
dwellings over the water, and that the same custom must have existed
as regards the other Swiss lakes.</p>

<p>This idea was developed by Dr. Keller in five very remarkable
memoirs, which were published in German.<a name="fnanchor_31"
id="fnanchor_31"></a><a href="#footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>This discovery was the spark which lighted up a torch destined
to dissipate the darkness which hung over a long-protracted and little-known
period of man's history.</p>

<p>Previous to the discovery made on the dried-up bed of the Lake of
Zurich, various instruments and singular utensils had been obtained
from the mud of some of the lakes of Switzerland, and piles had often
been noticed standing up in the depth of the water; but no one had
been able to investigate these vestiges of another age, or had had any
idea of ascribing to them anything like the remote antiquity which
has since been recognised as belonging to them. To Dr. Keller
the honour is due of having interpreted these facts in their real
bearing, at a time when every one else looked upon them as nothing
but objects of curiosity. It is, therefore, only just to pronounce the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"> [Pg 217]</a></span>
physician of Zurich to have been the first originator of pre-historic
archæological science in Switzerland.</p>

<p>In 1854, after the publication of Dr. Keller's first article, the
Swiss lakes were explored with much energy, and it was not long
before numerous traces of human settlements were discovered. At
the present day more than 200 are known, and every year fresh ones
are being found.<a name="fnanchor_32"
id="fnanchor_32"></a><a href="#footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Thanks to the activity which has been shown by a great number of
observers, magnificent collections have been formed of these archæological
treasures. The fishermen of the lakes have been acquainted,
for many years back, with the sites of some of these settlements, in
consequence of having, on many occasions, torn their nets on the piles
sticking up in the mud. Numerous questions were asked them, and
they were taken as guides to the different spots, and ere long a whole
system of civilisation, heretofore unknown, emerged from the beds of
the Swiss lakes.</p>

<p>Among the lakes which have furnished the largest quantity of
relics of pre-historic ages, we may mention that of Neuchâtel, in which,
in 1867, no less than forty-six settlements were counted; in Lake
Constance (thirty-two settlements); in the Lake of Geneva (twenty-four
settlements); in the Lake of Bienne, canton of Berne (twenty
settlements); in the Lake of Morat, canton of Fribourg (eight settlements).</p>

<p>Next come several other lakes of less importance. The Lake of
Zurich (three settlements); the Lake of Pfæffikon, canton of Zurich
(four settlements); the Lake of Sempach, canton of Lucerne (four
settlements); the Lake of Moosseedorf, canton of Berne (two settlements);
the Lake of Inkwyl, near Soleure (one settlement); the
Lake of Nussbaumen, canton of Thurgau (one settlement); the Lake
of Zug, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Pile-work has also been discovered in former lakes now transformed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"> [Pg 218]</a></span>
into peat-bogs. We must place in this class the peat-bog of Wauwyl,
canton of Lucerne (five settlements).</p>

<p>We will mention, in the last place, the settlement at the bridge of
Thièle, on the water-course which unites the lakes of Bienne and
Neuchâtel. This settlement must once have formed a portion of the
Lake of Bienne, at the time when the latter extended as far as the
bridge of Thièle.</p>

<p>The lacustrine villages of Switzerland do not all belong to the same
period. The nature of the remains that they contain indubitably
prove that some are far more ancient than others. The vestiges have
been discovered of three successive epochs&mdash;the polished-stone epoch
and the epochs of bronze and of iron.</p>

<p>The lacustrine settlements of Switzerland, when considered under
the heads of the various pre-historical epochs to which they belong,
may be divided in the following way:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Stone Age</i>:&mdash;The Lake of Constance (about thirty settlements);
the Lake of Neuchâtel (twelve settlements); the Lake of Geneva (two
settlements); the Lake of Morat (one settlement); the lakes of Bienne,
Zurich, Pfæffikon, Inkwyl, Moosseedorf, Nussbaumen, Wanger, &amp;c.;
the settlements of Saint-Aubin and Concise, the peat-bog of Wauwyl,
and the settlement at the Bridge of Thièle.</p>

<p><i>The Bronze Epoch</i>:&mdash;The Lake of Geneva (twenty settlements);
the Lake of Neuchâtel (twenty-five settlements); the Lake of Bienne
(ten settlements); also the lakes of Morat and Sempach.</p>

<p><i>The Iron Epoch</i>:&mdash;The lakes of Neuchâtel and Bienne.</p>

<p>It may appear strange that the primitive inhabitants of Switzerland
should have preferred aquatic dwellings to habitations built on <i>terra
firma</i>, which could certainly have been constructed much more
easily. Further on in our work we shall have something to say as
to the advantages which men might derive from such a peculiar
arrangement of their dwellings; but we may now remark that this custom
was somewhat prevalent among the earliest inhabitants of Europe.
Ancient history furnishes us with several instances of it. Herodotus,
speaking of the Pæonians, of the Lake Prasias, in Thrace, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Their habitations are built in the following way. On long piles,
sunk into the bottom of the lake, planks are placed, forming a
floor; a narrow bridge is the means of access to them. These piles
used to be fixed by the inhabitants at their joint expense; but afterwards
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"> [Pg 219]</a></span>
it was settled that each man should bring three from Mount
Orbelus for every woman whom he married. Plurality of wives, be
it observed, was permitted in this country. On these planks each has
his hut with a trap-door down into the lake; and lest any of their
children should fall through this opening they took care to attach
a cord to their feet. They used to feed their horses and beasts of
burden on fish. In this lake fish was so abundant that if a basket
was let down through the trap-door it might be drawn up a short
time afterwards filled with fish."</p>

<p>Sir J. Lubbock, repeating the statement of one of his friends who
resides at Salonica, asserts that the fishermen of the Lake Prasias still
inhabit wooden huts built over the water, as in the time of Herodotus.
There is nothing improbable in this, since the town of Tcherkask in
Russia is constructed in a similar way over the River Don, and
Venice itself is nothing but a lacustrine city built during historic
times over a lagune of the Adriatic sea.</p>

<p>We may add that even in modern times this custom of building
villages on piles still exists in some parts of the world. According to
the evidence of Dampier and Dumont d'Urville, habitations built on
piles are to be met with in New Guinea, Celebes, Ceram, Mindanao,
the Caroline Islands, &amp;c. The city of Borneo is, indeed, entirely
built on this plan. In some of the isles of the Pacific Ocean there
are several tribes of savages who likewise make their dwellings over
water. The Indians of Venezuela have adopted this custom with the
sole intention of sheltering themselves from the mosquitoes.</p>

<p>It is quite permissible to suppose that the need for security was
the motive which induced the ancient inhabitants of Switzerland, and
other countries, thus to make settlements and live upon the lakes.
Surrounded as they were by vast marshes and impenetrable forests,
they lived in dread of the attacks of numerous wild beasts. They
therefore taxed their ingenuity to insure their safety as far as they
possibly could, and no means appeared more efficacious than that of
surrounding themselves with water. At a subsequent period, when
men commenced to make war against one another, these aquatic habitations
became still more valuable. They then constituted something
in the nature of camps or fortification in which, being well-protected
from all danger of sudden surprise, the people of the country could
defy the efforts of their enemies.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"> [Pg 220]</a></span></p>
<p>We must, however, add, that in more recent times these buildings
on piles were&mdash;according to M. Desor&mdash;used only as storehouses for
utensils and provisions; the actual dwellings for men being built on
<i>terra firma</i>.</p>

<p>These lacustrine dwellings are designated under various names by
different authors. Dr. Keller, who was the first to describe them,
gave them in German the name of <i>pfahlbauten</i> (buildings on piles)
which the Italians have translated by the word <i>palafitta</i>. This
latter appellation, when gallicized by M. Desor, becomes <i>palafitte</i>.
Lastly, the name <i>ténevières</i> or <i>steinbergs</i> (mountains of stone) is
given to constructions of a peculiar character in which the piles are
kept up by masses of stone which have been brought to the spot.
By Dr. Keller, this latter kind are called <i>packwerkbauten</i>.</p>

<p>When we examine as a whole the character of the lacustrine settlements
which have hitherto been discovered, it may, in fact, be perceived
that those who built them proceeded on two different systems
of construction; either, they buried the piles very deeply in the bed
of the lake, and on these piles placed the platform which was to
support their huts; or, they artificially raised the bed of the lake by
means of heaps of stones, fixing in these heaps somewhat large stakes,
not so much for the purpose of supporting the habitations themselves as
with a view of making the heaps of stones a firm and compact body.</p>

<div class="figcenter topspace2"><a name="i_279.jpg" id="i_279.jpg"></a>
<img src="images/i_279.jpg"
alt="Ténevière of Hauterive"  />
<div class="caption">Fig. 148.&mdash;Section of the <i>Ténevière</i> of Hauterive.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">This latter mode of construction is represented in fig. 148, taken
from a design given by M. Desor in his remarkable work 'Les
Palafittes.'<a name="fnanchor_33"
id="fnanchor_33"></a><a href="#footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>One or the other of these modes of construction was employed
according to the nature of the bed of the lake. In lakes with a
muddy bottom, the first plan could be easily employed; but when the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"> [Pg 221]</a></span>
bed was rocky, it was necessary to have recourse to the second. This
is the reason why on the northern shore of the Lake of Neuchâtel,
where the banks of limestone come very close to the surface, a comparatively
large number of <i>ténevières</i> may be observed.</p>

<p>These are the facts as generally noticed, especially in wide and deep
lakes; the edifice, however, was not always constructed in this mode.
In marshes and small lakes, which have now become peat-bogs, another
system was frequently applied, a remarkable instance of which is
furnished by the peat-moss at Wauwyl. In this locality were found
several quadrangular spaces very distinctly enclosed by piles, between
which were raised as many as five platforms one above the other.
These piles are naturally very long, and some are buried as much as
seven feet in the solid ground&mdash;an operation which must have required
an enormous amount of labour. The intervals between the platforms
are filled up with boughs of trees and clay, and the floors themselves
are made in nearly the same way as those we have before mentioned.
The lowest rested directly on the bed of the lake, and on the upper
one the huts were placed.</p>

<p>It is sometimes the case that these heaps of stones rise above the
water; they then form perfect artificial islands, and the habitations
which covered them are no longer, properly speaking, dwellings on
piles. Of this kind is the station on the Lake of Inkwyl in Switzerland;
of this kind, also, are the <i>crannoges</i> of Ireland, of which we
shall subsequently make special mention. Some of these artificial
islands have braved the destructive action of ages, and are still inhabited
at the present time. M. Desor mentions the Isle of Roses in
the Lake of Starnberg (Bavaria) which has never been known to
have been unfrequented by man; it now contains a royal residence.</p>

<p>Let us revert to the mode of construction of the aquatic dwellings
of Switzerland.</p>

<p>In all probability the stones used were conveyed to the required
spot by means of canoes made of hollowed-out trunks of trees. Several
of these canoes may still be seen at the bottom of Lake Bienne, and
one, indeed, is still laden with pebbles, which leads us to think that
it must have foundered with its cargo. But it is very difficult to raise
these canoes from the bottom, and it is, besides, probable that when
exposed to the open air they would fall to dust. Nevertheless, one of
them is exhibited in the Museum at Neuchâtel.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"> [Pg 222]</a></span></p>
<p>In the Museum at Saint-Germain there is a canoe very similar to
that of Neuchâtel. It is made out of the trunk of a hollow tree. A
second canoe, very like the first, but with the bark still on it, and in a
bad state of preservation, lies in the entry of the same Museum of
Saint-Germain. It was taken out of the Seine, as we stated when
speaking in a previous chapter of the first discovery of the art of
navigation during the Stone Age.</p>

<p>It may very easily be explained how the constructors went to work
in felling the trees and converting them into piles. M. Desor has
remarked that the pieces of wood composing the piles are cut cleanly
through round their circumference only; the central part shows
inequalities just like those which are noticed when a stick is broken in
two by the hand after having been cut into all round the outside.
The builders of the lacustrine villages, therefore, when they wanted
to fell a tree must have acted much as follows: having cut all round
it to a depth of 3 or 4 inches, they fixed a cord to the top, and
broke the tree down by forcibly pulling at the upper part. They
then cut it through in the same way with stone or bronze hatchets,
giving it the requisite length, hewing it into a point at one end so that
it should more easily penetrate the mud. Sometimes a fire applied to
the base of the tree prepared for, and facilitated, the effect of the sharp
instruments used. A great number of the piles that have been found
still bear the marks of the fire and the cuts made by stone hatchets.
In constructing the <i>ténevières</i>, the labour of pointing the piles was
needless, as the latter were thoroughly wedged in by the accumulation
of stones of which we gave a representation in fig. 148.</p>

<p>When the piles were prepared, they had to be floated to the
spot fixed upon for the village, and to be fixed in the bed of the
lake. If we consider that, in many cases, the length of these piles
reached to as much as 16 or 20 feet, some idea may be formed of the
difficulty of an undertaking of this kind. In the construction of
the <i>ténevières</i> much thicker piles were used, and the labour was much
less difficult. For instance, in the more ancient <i>ténevières</i> of the Lake
of Neuchâtel piles are found made of whole trunks of trees which
measure 10 to 12 inches in diameter.</p>

<p>The mind is almost confused when it endeavours to sum up the
amount of energy and strong will which the primitive population of
Switzerland must have bestowed on constructing, unaided as they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"> [Pg 223]</a></span>
were by metal implements, the earliest lacustrine settlements, some of
which are of very considerable extent. The settlement of Morges,
one of the largest in the Lake of Geneva, is not less than 71,000
square yards in area. That of Chabrey, in the Lake of Neuchâtel,
measures about 60,000 square yards; another, in the same lake,
48,000 yards; and, lastly, a third, that of La Tène, 36,000 yards.
There are many others which are smaller, although of respectable
dimensions.</p>

<p>The number of piles which must have been used in some of these
constructions is really surprising. M. Löhle has calculated that in
the single lacustrine village of Wangen, in the Lake of Constance,
at least 40,000 piles have been fixed, and that several generations
must have been necessary to terminate the work. The more reasonable
interpretation to give to a fact of this kind is that Wangen,
which was very thinly populated at first, increased in size gradually
as the numbers of inhabitants augmented. The same remark may be
doubtless applied to all the important stations.</p>

<p>This was the plan employed in building a single habitation. When
a whole village had to be built in the open water, a methodical course
of action was adopted. They began by placing a certain number of
piles parallel to the shore, and these they at once threw across the
bridge which was intended to connect the village with the land, thus
rendering the carriage of the materials much less difficult.</p>

<p>When the bridge was finished, and before fixing all the piles, the
platform was commenced immediately; this constituted a base of
operations, by the help of which the pile work could more easily
be finished.</p>

<p>This platform was raised 3 or 4 feet above the surface of the water,
so as to obviate any danger arising from the waves during a tempest.
It was generally composed of branches and trunks of trees not
squared, and bound horizontally to each other, the whole cemented
together with clay; sometimes, also, they used thick rough slabs,
which were obtained by splitting trunks of trees with wedges. The
platform was fixed firmly on the pile-work, and in some cases wooden
pegs were used to fasten together the largest pieces of timber, so that
the cohesion and incorporation of the floor were rendered more
complete. As soon as the esplanade was finished, they then proceeded
to the construction of the huts.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"> [Pg 224]</a></span></p>
<p>The huts must have opened on to the platform by doors. Did
they possess windows? Nothing is known as to this point. But in
all probability there was an opening at the top of the roof, through
which the smoke of the fire made its way. To avoid any fear of
conflagration, a stone fire-place was placed in the middle of each
dwelling. The daylight must have come in through the hole in the
roof in a quantity almost sufficient to cause the absence of windows
to be not much felt.</p>

<p>In each habitation, there was, no doubt, a trap-door in direct communication
with the lake, such as those which existed in the dwellings
of the Pæonians described by Herodotus. Under this trap-door there
was a reservoir made of osiers, intended for the preservation of fish.</p>

<p>As the inhabitants of the lacustrine villages only lived upon the
water with a view of increasing their security, it would be absurd to
suppose that they would construct a large number of bridges between
their aquatic settlement and the banks of the lake. There must
have been, in general, but one bridge for each of these lake villages.</p>

<p>How were the huts constructed, and what were their shape and
dimensions? These questions certainly seem difficult to answer, for,
as may be well imagined, no specimen of these ancient dwellings has
been preserved to our days. Nevertheless, a few relics, insignificant
in appearance, enable us to reply to these inquiries in a way more or
less satisfactory.</p>

<p>Everything seems to indicate that the huts were formed of trunks
of trees placed upright, one by the side of the other, and bound together
horizontally by interwoven branches. A coating of earth
covered this wattling.</p>

<p>It has been fancied, from the imprint left by some of the branches
which were used in building these huts, that it might be inferred that
they were circular, like those which historians attribute to the ancient
Gauls. This was Troyon's opinion, and at first Dr. Keller's also.
This author has even sketched a circular hut in a plate representing
a restored lacustrine habitation, which accompanies one of his
memoirs. Sir C. Lyell, also, has reproduced this same plate in the
frontispiece of his work on the 'Antiquity of Man.' But Dr.
Keller has subsequently abandoned this idea, and in another of his
memoirs he has supplied a fresh design showing nothing but huts
with flat or sloping roofs.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"> [Pg 225]</a></span></p>
<p>From this latter plate, taken from Dr. Keller's work, we here give
a representation of a Swiss lacustrine village (fig. 149).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">The suggestions for this reconstructive sketch were furnished to
Dr. Keller not only by various scientific indications, but also and
especially by a drawing made by Dumont d'Urville among the Papuans
of New Guinea.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Keller, during the last century there still existed
on the river Limmat, near Zurich, some fishermen's huts built in a
similar way to those of the lacustrine villages.</p>

<p>What might have been the population of one of these settlements?
This estimate M. Troyon endeavoured to make&mdash;an undertaking of a
very interesting nature. He adopted as the base of his calculations
the lacustrine village of Morges (Lake of Geneva), which, as we have
already stated, had an area of 71,000 square yards. Allowing that
only one-half of this area was occupied by huts, the other half being
reserved for gangways between the dwellings, and assuming an
average diameter of 16 feet for each hut, M. Troyon reckoned the
number of dwellings in the pre-historic village of Morges at 311.
Next, supposing that four individuals lived in each hut, the total
amount of population he arrived at was 1244 inhabitants.</p>

<p>We might very justly be surprised if men of the bronze epoch,
who were provided with metallic weapons, and were consequently in
a much better position for resisting any violent attack, had continued
to dwell exclusively in the midst of the water, and should not, to
some extent, have dispersed over <i>terra firma</i>, which is man's natural
standing-ground. It was, therefore, nothing more than might have
been expected, when the discovery was made of the relics of dwellings
upon land, containing remains of the bronze epoch. This discovery,
in fact, took place, and those investigating the subject came to the
conclusion that the valleys of Switzerland, as well as the lakes, were
occupied during this period by an industrious and agricultural people.</p>

<p>At Ebersberg, canton of Zurich, there was discovered&mdash;which is a
very curious fact&mdash;the remains of an ancient settlement situated on
<i>terra firma</i>, and containing utensils similar to those found in the
lacustrine settlements. In 1864, Dr. Clement searched several
mounds composed of pebbles bearing the traces of fire; these mounds
were situated in the neighbourhood of Gorgier (canton of Neuchâtel).
One of these mounds has furnished various objects of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"> [Pg 226]</a></span>
bronze intermingled with fragments of charcoal, especially a bracelet
and some sickles characterised by a projection or set-off at the spring
of the blade.</p>

<p>On the plateau of Granges (canton of Soleure), Dr. Schild studied
a certain spot which he considers to be the site of an ancient bronze
foundry; for, besides finding there pebbles and calcined earth, he also
discovered a number of reaping-hooks made with a shoulder, and also
a fragment of a sword and four finely-made knives.</p>

<p>A hatchet-knife was likewise found in the gorge of the Seyon, near
Neuchâtel; and a bracelet in the vicinity of Morges (canton of
Geneva). Some other bracelets, accompanied by calcined human
bones, were discovered near Sion, in the Valais.</p>

<p>Lastly, M. Thioly obtained from a cave of Mont Salève, near
Geneva, numerous fragments of pottery of the bronze epoch; and in
a grotto on the banks of the Reuse, in the canton of Neuchâtel,
M. Otz found relics of pottery of very fine clay, along with a quantity
of bones.</p>

<p>Thus the people of this epoch did not dwell exclusively in settlements
made over the water. They also were in the habit of building
habitations on <i>terra firma</i>, and of furnishing them with everything
which was necessary for existence.</p>

<p>All the facts which have been observed in Switzerland may, doubtless,
be applied generally; and it may be said that during the bronze
epoch the nature of man's habitation became decidedly fixed. The
caves of the great bear and mammoth period, and the rock-shelters
of the reindeer and polished-stone periods were now succeeded by
dwelling-places which differ but little from those of the more civilised
peoples who commence the era of historic times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was difficult to believe that Switzerland alone possessed the monopoly
of these pile-work-constructions. It was certainly to be supposed
that the southern slopes of the Alps, which were all dotted over with
large and beautiful lakes, must likewise contain constructions of a
similar character; this, at least, was M. Desor's opinion. After the
numerous pre-historic discoveries which had been made in Switzerland,
the Zurich professor proceeded in 1860 to explore the lakes of Lombardy,
being well convinced that there too he should find remains of
lacustrine habitations.</p>

<p>The hopes he had formed were not deceived. Ere long, in fact,
M. Desor obtained from the peat-bogs round Lake Maggiore piles and
other objects similar to those found in the Swiss lakes. These researches
were continued by MM. Gastaldi and Moro, who discovered
in the peat-bogs round this lake several ancient villages built upon piles.</p>

<p>In the Lake of Varese, also in Lombardy, which was examined in
1863 by MM. Desor, G. de Mortillet, and the Abbé Stoppani, were
discovered five settlements, some of which were of the Stone Age.
Subsequently, the Abbé Ranchet pointed out four others, which raise
to the number of nine the pile works found in this lake. In order to
render due honour to MM. Keller and Desor, who have contributed so
much to the investigation and popularity of lacustrine antiquities, the
Abbé Stoppani gave the name of these <i>savants</i> to two of the settlements.</p>

<p>One of these isles is very curious, as it is inhabited up to the present
day. It is called <i>Isoletta</i> ("small island"), and the Litta family
possess a <i>château</i> upon it.</p>

<p>In the peat-mosses of Brianza, a portion of Lombardy situated to
the north of Milan, the remains of lacustrine constructions have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"> [Pg 228]</a></span>
discovered, together with bones, fragments of pottery, pieces of charcoal,
and carbonised stone; also weapons, both of bronze and flint.</p>

<p>The Lake of Garda has been searched over by various explorers,
who have discovered in it the sites of several lacustrine habitations.
The authors of these discoveries are Dr. Alberti, of Verona, and MM.
Kosterlitz and Silber, two Austrian officers, who presented all the
objects which they collected to the antiquarian museums of Vienna
and Zurich. The traces of pile-works were first perceived when the
works were in progress which were excavated by the Austrians in
1855 round the fortress of Peschiera; which proves, at least, that
fortresses may occasionally serve some useful purpose.</p>

<p>A settlement of the Stone Age, which was examined by M. Paolo
Lioy, is situated in a small lake in Venetia, the length of which does
not exceed half a mile, and the depth 30 feet; we allude to the
Lake of Fimon, near Vicenza. M. Lioy discovered oaken piles partially
charred, which proves that the village had at one time been
burnt down; also slabs of timber roughly squared, a canoe hollowed
out of a trunk of oak, cakes of clay which had come from the sides of
huts, and still bore the imprint of the reed-stalks, and no doubt
formed a kind of coating inside the huts; various instruments made
of bone, flint, sandstone, granite, and stag's horn; rings or spindle-weights
made of burnt earth, numerous fragments of rough pottery,
merely dried in the sun, and, among all these remains, a dozen entire
vessels.</p>

<p>There were also found stores of acorns, nuts, and water-chestnuts,
the fruit of the sorb-tree, some sloe-stones, &amp;c. A large quantity of
animal bones certified to the existence of the bison, the stag, the wild
boar, the fox, and several other doubtful species. All the long bones
were broken, as is usually the case, for the extraction of the marrow,
but not with the ordinary regularity; they had merely been cracked
by blows with stones.</p>

<p>The investigation of lacustrine antiquities which had been inaugurated
in Switzerland could hardly stop short in its path of progress.
Attempts were made to discover <i>palafittes</i> in other countries, and
these attempts met with success.</p>

<p>Thanks to the initiative action taken by M. Desor, and the liberality
of the Bavarian Government, pile-works of ancient date have been
discovered in six of the Bavarian lakes. Most of them go back to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"> [Pg 229]</a></span>
Stone Age, but some belong to the bronze epoch. Among the latter
we may mention the <i>Isle of Roses</i>, in the Lake of Starnberg, which
is, in fact, an artificial island, like the Isoletta in the Lake of Varese.
We have previously stated that this island has never ceased to be
inhabited, and that a <i>château</i> now exists on it.</p>

<p>The movement spread from one place to another. Austria made it
a point of honour not to remain in the rear of Bavaria, and Professor
Hochstetter was commissioned by the Academy of Sciences at Vienna to
undertake a search for <i>palafittes</i> in the lakes of Carinthia and Carniola.</p>

<p>These explorations were not without result. In four lakes of
Carinthia, Dr. Hochstetter discovered piles, remains of pottery, bones,
nuts, &amp;c. In the Lake of Reutschach, which was the most closely
investigated, he discovered shallows formed by stones, similar to the
<i>steinbergs</i> of Switzerland. The marshes of Laybach have also furnished
instruments of stag's horn, a perforated stone, and a canoe.</p>

<p>Next to Austria, Prussia took the matter up. Specimens of pile-work
were discovered in several provinces of this kingdom; among
these were Brandenburg and Pomerania, a district rich in marshes.
In the environs of Lubtow the lacustrine constructions have the same
characteristics as those of Robenhausen, on the Lake of Pfæffikon
(Switzerland). Two distinct archæological strata may be distinguished;
in the lower are found, all mingled together, bronze and stone instruments,
fragments of pottery, wheat, barley, and charred peas; the
upper stratum belongs to the iron age.</p>

<p>We have not as yet said anything about France; lacustrine dwellings
have, however, been discovered in some of the departments which
border on Switzerland.</p>

<p>The Lakes of Bourget and Annecy, in Savoy, contain several of
them. The former of these lakes was thoroughly explored by
M. Laurent Rabut, author of an article on the 'Habitations Lacustres
de la Savoie,' which obtained a silver medal at the competition of the
learned societies in 1863. In the Lake of Bourget, M. Rabut ascertained
the existence of five or six settlements of the bronze epoch,
three of which, those of Tresserve, Grésine and Châtillon, have been
distinguished as furnishing numerous ancient relics.</p>

<p>The Lake of Paladru (Isère) which has been searched by M. Gustave
Vallier, has afforded similar results. Pile-works are thought to exist
in some other small lakes in the same district&mdash;those of Sainte-Hélène,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"> [Pg 230]</a></span>
on the left bank of the Isère, Saint-Martin-de-Belville, and Saint-Marcel,
near Moutiers. Pile-works have also been discovered on the
site of an ancient lake on the banks of the Saône; and in a totally
different district, at the foot of the Pyrenees, as many as five have
been pointed out.</p>

<p>Everything therefore leads us to believe that if we searched with
care the peat-mosses and pools which are very common in a good
many of the French departments, we should discover the vestiges of
various pre-historic epochs.</p>

<p>In order to complete the enumeration of the lacustrine constructions
of Europe, we may state that they have been found in Denmark in
the Lake of Maribo, and in England in the county of Norfolk.</p>

<p>With these constructions we must also connect the <i>crannoges</i> or
artificial islands of Ireland, the first of which was discovered in 1836
by Sir W. R. Wilde, a member of the Royal Academy of Dublin. Since
this date various investigations have been made of these objects, and,
at the present time, no less than fifty <i>crannoges</i> have been discovered,
distributed among the various counties of Ireland.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 150.&mdash;Vertical Section of a
<i>Crannoge</i> in the Ardakillin Lake.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">Most of these islets were composed of heaps of stones held together
by piles, nearly in the same way as in the <i>ténevières</i> in Switzerland;
but the <i>crannoges</i> differ from the latter in being raised above the
water. Some of them, however, are formed by a collection of vertical
piles and horizontal joists, constituting an external inclosure, and
even internal compartments, inside which all kinds of remains were
collected. This kind are called <i>stockaded</i> islands. They are generally
of an oval or circular shape, and their dimensions are always kept
within rather narrow limits. In his work on 'Pre-historic Times,'
Sir John Lubbock gives the above sketch of a <i>crannoge</i> in the
Ardakillin Lake.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"> [Pg 231]</a></span></p>
<p>Captain Mudge, of the Royal British Navy, has described a hut
which he found at a depth of 16 feet, in the Drumkellin marsh. Its
area was about 5 feet square, and its height 10 feet; it included two
stories, each about 4&frac12; feet high. The roof was flat, and the hut was
surrounded by a fence of piles, doubtless intended to separate it from
other adjacent huts, the remains of which are still to be perceived.
The whole construction had been executed by means of stone instruments,
a fact that was proved by the nature of the cuts that were still
visible on some of the pieces of wood. Added to this, a hatchet, a
chisel, and an arrow-head, all made of flint, were found on the floor of
the cabin, and left no doubt whatever on this point. This, therefore,
was in fact a habitation belonging to the Stone Age. Some nuts and
a large quantity of broken shells were scattered over the ground. A
large flat stone, perforated with a little hole in the middle, was found
on the spot; it was probably used to break the nuts by means of round
pebbles picked up outside.</p>

<p>From some of these settlements considerable masses of bones have
been obtained, which have, alas, been utilised as manure. Sir John
Lubbock tells us that the <i>crannoge</i> of Dunshauglin alone has
furnished more than 150 cartloads of bones. These bones belong to
the following species:&mdash;the ox, the pig, the goat, the sheep, the horse,
the ass, the dog, the fox, the roe, the fallow-deer, and the great Irish
stag, now extinct. If all other proof were wanting, the presence of
the remains of this latter animal would be sufficient to indicate that
certain <i>crannoges</i> date back to the Stone Age; but as in this case we
evidently have to do with the polished-stone epoch, it is also proved
that the gigantic antlered stag existed in Ireland at a much later date
than on the continent.</p>

<p>Various historical records testify to the fact, that the <i>crannoges</i> were
inhabited up to the end of the sixteenth century. They then constituted
a kind of fortress, in which petty chiefs braved for a long
time the royal power. After the definitive pacification of the country
they were completely abandoned.</p>

<div class="chapsum">Palustrine Habitations or Marsh-Villages&mdash;Surveys made by MM. Strobel and
Pigorini of the <i>Terramares</i> of Tuscany&mdash;The <i>Terramares</i> of Brazil.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> described the <i>lacustrine</i> habitations which have been discovered
in various parts of Europe, we must now mention the so-called
<i>palustrine</i> habitations, as peculiar to the bronze epoch. This name
has been given to that kind of village, the remains of which have
been discovered round marshes and pools. Upper Italy is the locality
in which these settlements have been pointed out.</p>

<p>The name of <i>palustrine settlements</i>, or <i>marnieras</i>, has been given to
the sites of ancient villages established by means of piles on marshes
or pools of no great size, which in the course of time have been
filled up by mould of a peaty character, containing a quantity of
organic and other <i>detritus</i>.</p>

<p>The discovery of those <i>palustrine settlements</i> is due to MM.
Strobel and Pigorini, who have designated them by the name of
<i>terramares</i>.</p>

<p>This term is applied by these <i>savants</i> to the accumulation of ashes,
charcoal, animal bones, and remains of all kinds which have been
thrown away by man all round his dwellings, and have accumulated
there during the lapse of centuries. The name which has been given
them was derived from the fact that they furnish a kind of earthy
ammoniacal manure, known in the district by the name of <i>terra
mare</i>.</p>

<p>These accumulations are the representatives of the Danish kitchen-middens;
but with this difference, that instead of dating back to the
Stone Age, the former belong to the bronze epoch.</p>

<p><i>Terramares</i> are numerous in the districts of Parma and Modena;
they are, however, almost entirely confined to the plain which extends
between the Po, the Apennines, the Adda, and the Reno, forming an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"> [Pg 233]</a></span>
area of about 60 miles long, and 30 miles wide. In a general way,
they form small mounds which rise from 6 to 12 feet above the
level of the plain; as they go down some depth in the ground, their
total thickness is in some places as much as 20 feet. Very few are
seen having an area exceeding 9 acres.</p>

<p>Excavations which have been made in several spots enable a
tolerably exact account to be given of the mode of construction
adopted in these palustrine settlements. The <i>marniera</i> of Castione, in
particular, has furnished us with valuable information on this point;
and we shall describe this settlement as a type of the rest. Piles from
6 to 10 feet in length, and 4 to 6 inches in diameter (fig. 151), formed
of trunks of trees, either whole or split, and pointed at the ends by
some rough tool, were sunk to the depth of some inches in the bed of
the hollow. Some of them still show on their tops the marks of the
blows that they received when they were driven in. They were placed
at intervals of from 18 inches to 6 feet; and connecting-beams from
6 to 10 feet in length, placed horizontally, and crossing one another,
bound the piles together, and insured the solidity of the whole construction.
On these cross-beams rested a floor (fig. 152) formed of
joists 1 to 3 inches thick, 6 to 12 inches wide, and 5 to 7 feet long.</p>

These slabs or joists
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"> [Pg 234]</a></span>
were not fixed in any way; at least, no trace now exists of any fastening.
They seemed to have been provided by splitting trunks of trees
by means of wooden wedges, a number of these wedges having been
found in the peaty earth. Neither the saw nor the gimlet appear
to have been employed; but the square holes have been cut out by
means of the chisel. The timber that was used was principally ash
and oak.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 153.&mdash;Plan of the Piles and Cross-beams
in the <i>Marniera</i> of Castione.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">The floor was covered with beaten earth to a thickness of 10 to 12
inches. Fragments of this kind of paving were found scattered about
in two sandy heaps, almost entirely devoid of other <i>débris</i>, whilst the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"> [Pg 235]</a></span>
adjacent earth, of a blackish colour, contained a large quantity of
relics of all kinds. It is probable that the huts of the inhabitants of
the <i>marniera</i> were situated upon these sandy heaps, and that the dark-coloured
earth is the final result of the accumulation of refuse and
various kinds of <i>detritus</i> on the same spot.</p>

<p>It is not known whether the layer of beaten earth extended over the
whole surface of the floor, or was confined to the interior of the
habitations. In the former case, it is probable that it was rammed
down with less care on the outside than on the inside of the huts, as
is shown by the discovery of a storehouse for corn, the floor of which
is formed by nothing but a layer of sandy earth placed upon the
planks. This storehouse, which, from the use to which it was put,
could not have been used as a dwelling by any one, measured 13 feet
in length, and 10 feet in width. It contained carbonised beans and
wheat, spread in a layer of about 4 inches thick.</p>

<p>MM. Strobel and Pigorini found no remains of huts in the
<i>marniera</i> of Castione: probably because, having been built entirely of
wood, they were completely destroyed by fire, numerous traces of
which may still be detected. In addition to the carbonised corn and
fruit already mentioned, many other objects bearing the evident marks
of fire were, in fact, collected at Castione. The floor-slabs, the tie-beams,
and the tops of the piles were often found to be half consumed.</p>

<p>But although at Castione there is no evidence forthcoming in
respect to huts, information which bears upon this point has been
obtained at other spots. MM. Strobel and Pigorini have ascertained
that the palustrine dwellings bore a great similarity to those on the
Swiss lakes. The sides were lined with boughs, and the interior was
daubed with clay. In Italy, just as in Switzerland, certain fragments
of the clayey coating which have been hardened and preserved by
fire have enabled us to draw these inferences.</p>

<p>At Castione several beds of ashes and charcoal containing remains
of meals, pointed out the sites of the domestic hearths, round which
they, doubtless, assembled to eat their food. Another bed of
charcoal, mixed with straw, wheat, and pieces of burnt pottery, was
found in a peculiar situation&mdash;it was embedded in a bank of calcareous
pebbles vitrified on the surface; this bank was about 5 feet wide, and
about 8 inches in thickness. The explorers thought that it was,
perhaps, a place which had been devoted to the fusion of metals.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"> [Pg 236]</a></span></p>
<p>On the edge of the basin of the marsh, a kind of rampart or defensive
work was discovered, composed of slabs as much as 16 feet
in length, laid horizontally one over the other. These slabs were tied
down by stakes driven in obliquely, and likewise placed one above the
other, their ends being inserted between the slabs.</p>

<p>This last discovery, added to other indications, led MM. Strobel and
Pigorini to the supposition that the pile-work of Castione, and doubtless
also those in all the <i>marnieras</i>, were in the first place constructed as
places of defence, and were subsequently converted into fixed and
permanent residences. The basin of the marsh having been gradually
filled up by the accumulations of <i>débris</i> resulting from the presence of
man, the habitations were built on a solid foundation, and a great
portion of the former floor was done away with, which would account
for so little of it now remaining.</p>

<p>The objects discovered in the <i>terramares</i> and <i>marnieras</i> do not essentially
differ from those found in the pile-works of Switzerland. They
are almost all worn or broken, just as might be expected from finding
them in rubbish heaps. There are a great quantity of fragments of
pottery of a greyish or dark-coloured clay mixed with grains of quartz,
imperfectly baked, and made without the aid of a potter's wheel. The
ornamentation is, in general, of a very simple character, but the shapes
of the ears, or handles, are very varied. Some of the vessels are furnished
with a spout or holes for the liquid to flow out. The <i>terramares</i>
also contain supports for vessels with round or pointed bottoms.</p>

<p>In the <i>marniera</i> of San Ambrogio a slab of pottery was found,
elliptical in shape, and about half an inch in thickness, concave on one
side and convex on the other, and pierced with seventeen circular
holes about a quarter of an inch in diameter. The idea was entertained
that this object was used as a kind of fire-grating, for it bore
traces of the long-continued action of fire.</p>

<p>The other objects most commonly found were weights made of baked
earth, and perhaps used for the weaving-loom, much worn in the
place where the cord passed through on which they were hung;
<i>fusaiolas</i>, or spindle-whorls, very varied both in shape and size, likewise
made of baked earth; large mill-stones with a polished surface.
Next, we have poniards or spear-heads, hatchets, and hair-pins, all
made of bronze. The <i>marniera</i> of San Ambrogio has furnished a
mould indicating that bronze was melted and cast in this district.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"> [Pg 237]</a></span></p>
<p>An attentive study of the bones of animals contained in the <i>terramares</i>
has led to the following information being obtained as to the
<i>fauna</i> of Upper Italy during the bronze epoch.</p>

<p>With respect to the mammals which lived in a wild state, the existence
has been ascertained of a species of stag of much greater size
than the present variety, and about equal to that of the lacustrine
settlements of Switzerland (fig. 154); also of a wild-boar, much more
powerful than that of Sardinia or even of Algeria, the roe, the bear,
the rat, and the porcupine. In different spots have been found
stags' horns and bones, and also sloe-stones which have retained the
impression of the teeth of some small rodent. The bear, the wild-boar,
the stag and the roe, have, at the present day, disappeared from
the country. The porcupine, too, has migrated into regions further
south, which leads to the supposition that the temperature of the provinces
of Parma and Modena is a little lowered since the date of the
bronze epoch.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord topspace2"><a name="i_298.jpg" id="i_298.jpg"></a>

alt="Chase"  />
<div class="caption">Fig. 154.&mdash;The Chase during the Bronze Epoch.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">It is to be remarked that in these settlements, contrary to what has
been noticed in Switzerland, in the lacustrine habitations belonging to
the Stone Age, the remains of wild animals are met with much more
rarely than those of domestic animals; this must be consequent on a
superior and more advanced stage of civilisation having existed in
Italy. Among the domestic species found we may mention the dog,
two breeds of which, of different sizes, must have existed; the pig of
the peat-bogs, the same variety as that of which the bones were discovered
in Switzerland; the horse, the remains of which, although
rare, testify to the existence of two breeds, one large and bulky, the
other of slighter and more elegant proportions; the ass, of which there
are but few bones, could not, therefore, have been very common; the
ox, the remains of which are on the contrary very abundant, like the
dog and the horse, is represented by two distinct breeds, the more
powerful of which appears to have descended from the <i>Bos primigenius</i>
or <i>Urus</i>; lastly, the sheep and the goat, the remains of which can
scarcely be clearly distinguished on account of their great anatomical
resemblance.</p>

<p>When we compare the present <i>fauna</i> with that of which we have
just given the details, we may perceive several important modifications.
Thus the pig of the peat-bogs, one breed of oxen, and a breed of sheep
(the smallest) have become entirely extinct; and the common sheep,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"> [Pg 238]</a></span>
the goat, the horse, and the ass have assumed much more important
dimensions. With regard to the wild species of mammals, we have
already said that some have become less in size, and others have disappeared.
Hence results one proof of a fact which is beyond dispute,
although often called in question, namely, that the intelligent action
of man working by means of domestication on wild natures, will ultimately
succeed in ameliorating, reclaiming, and perfecting them.</p>

<p>The skulls and the long bones found in the <i>terramares</i> are almost
always broken for the purpose of extracting the brain and the marrow,
a very ancient usage which had endured to this comparatively late
epoch. But instead of being split longitudinally, as was the case in
preceding epochs, they are generally broken across at one end. The
<i>terramares</i> and the <i>kitchen-middens</i> have this peculiarity in common&mdash;that
all the dogs' skulls found in them have been intentionally broken;
a fact which proves that in Italy, as in Denmark, this faithful guest
or servant of man was occasionally, in default of some better food, and
doubtless with much regret, used as an article of subsistence.</p>

<p>No remains of fish have been found in these <i>marnieras</i>; from this,
MM. Strobel and Pigorini have justly concluded that the inhabitants
of these pile-works were not fishermen, and that, at all events, the
water which surrounded them was shallow and of limited extent.</p>

<p>The species of birds, molluscs and insects, the remains of which
have been found in the <i>terramares</i>, are likewise determined. The
existence of the domestic fowl and the duck, no doubt living in complete
liberty, has been duly recognised; but it is thought that the
appearance of these species must not be dated further back than the
<i>end</i> of the bronze epoch, and perhaps even the beginning of that of
iron.</p>

<p>The examination of the insect remains has enabled us to ascertain
that the refuse food and rubbish must have lain for some little time in
front of the doors of the habitations before it was pushed into the
water; for in it, flies, and other insects of the kind, found time to be
born, to mature, and to undergo their whole series of metamorphoses;
a fact which is proved by the perforated and empty envelopes of their
chrysalides.</p>

<p>We mention this last fact as one of the most curious instances of
the results which science and inference may, in combination, arrive at
when devoted to the novel and interesting study of some of the earlier
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"> [Pg 239]</a></span>
stages in man's existence. But, on the other hand, it gives us but a
poor idea of the cleanliness of the Italian race during the bronze epoch.
It would seem to us that a feeling of the dignity inherent in the body
of man, and the cares that it so imperiously claims, would have been
now more strongly developed than at a period when men dwelt confined
in caves. This, however, is not the case. But have we, in the
present day, any right to be astonished when we see, even now, the
prevalence, in some of the great cities of America, of certain practices
so disgusting in character and so opposed to the public health?
Osculati, an Italian traveller, relates that at all the street corners in
the city of Guayaquil, in the republic of Ecuador, heaps of filth are to
be seen which exhale an insupportable odour. Similar heaps exist at
the very gates of Mexico, where, at the present time, they form small
hills. These facts ought to render us indulgent towards the neglect of
cleanliness by our ancestors during the bronze epoch.</p>

<p>Such were the animal remains collected in the <i>terramares</i>. The
vegetable remains consisted of grains of carbonised corn, broken nuts,
acorns, halves of burnt apples, stones of the dog-berry, plums and
grapes.</p>

<p>In concluding our consideration of the palustrine settlements, we
may add, that some have recently been discovered in Moravia and
Mecklenburg. At Olmutz, a city of Moravia, M. Jeitteler, a learned
Viennese, has found piles sunk into the peat, along with various
bronze and stone objects, ornamented pottery, charcoal, charred wheat,
numerous animal bones, and a human skeleton of a brachycephalous
race. All the facts lead to the belief that this will not be the last
discovery of the kind.</p>

<p>We must also state that the <i>terramares</i>, or deposits of the remains
of habitations on the edge of marshes, are not peculiar to Europe
exclusively. On the coast of Africa (at San Vicente) M. Strobel found
remains of an exactly similar nature; and Dr. Henrique Naegeli, a
distinguished naturalist of Rio Janeiro, has testified to the existence
on the coast of Brazil of like deposits, which he proposes to subject to
a thorough examination.<a name="fnanchor_35"

<div class="chapsum">Weapons, Instruments, and Utensils contained in the various Lacustrine Settlements
in Europe, enabling us to become acquainted with the Manners and Customs
of Man during the Bronze Epoch.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have just spoken of the discovery and investigation of the <i>lacustrine
habitations</i> found in various parts of Europe, and also of the
<i>palustrine villages</i> of Northern Italy. These rich deposits have
thrown a considerable light on the primitive history of the human
race. With the elements that have been thus placed at our disposal,
it will be possible to reconstruct the domestic life of the tribes of the
bronze epoch, that is, to describe the weapons, instruments, and utensils
which were proper to the every-day proceedings of this period.</p>

<p>In order to give perspicuity to our representation or account, we
have classed the lacustrine habitations under the head of the <i>bronze
</i>epoch. But we must by no means forget that these lacustrine villages
contained other objects besides those belonging to the bronze
epoch; there were also found in them a number of articles which must
be referred to the preceding period, that is, the polished-stone epoch.</p>

<p>It is a question indifferent to our purpose, whether the lacustrine
villages were constructed during the Stone Age, as inferred from the
presence in some settlements of stone objects only, or whether the
habitations were built during the bronze epoch, some of the articles
made of stone and dating back to the preceding period being still
preserved in use. For it is certain that the larger number of lacustrine
settlements do not go back beyond the bronze epoch. But as
certain objects made of stone form a portion of the implements found
in these ancient habitations, we must commence by describing these
relics of the Stone Age; although we shall considerably abridge this
description, so as to avoid repeating those details which we have
already given in the preceding chapters.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"> [Pg 241]</a></span></p>
<p>The stone weapons and instruments are found to consist, in Switzerland
as elsewhere, of hatchets, spear-heads and arrow-heads, hammers,
saws, knives and chisels.</p>

<p>The hatchets and hammers are made of various materials, as flint,
quartzite, diorite, nephrite, jade, serpentine, &amp;c. But the other
weapons and implements are, nearly all of them, of flint.</p>

<p>The hatchet was in continual use, not merely as a weapon but as a
tool; thus, very numerous specimens of it are found in the Swiss lakes.</p>

<p>The hatchets, however, are generally speaking, small in size. Their
length varies from 2 to 8 inches, and their width, at the cutting edge,
from 1&frac12; to 2 inches. Fig. 155 represents one of the flint hatchets.
They are the same shape as the Danish hatchets during the polished-stone
epoch.</p>

</div>

<p class="topspace2">The most simple plan of fixing a handle to the small-sized hatchets,
which were in fact chisels, consisted in inserting them into a piece of
stag's horn, hollowed out for this purpose at one end. In this way
they obtained a kind of chisel which was very ready of use. Fig. 156
represents this kind of handle.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 156.&mdash;Stone Chisel with Stag's-horn
Handle from the Lacustrine Habitations of Switzerland.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">There was also another mode of fixing handles to these instruments.
The shaped flint was previously fixed in a holder of stag's horn.
This holder was itself perforated through the middle with a round hole,
in order to receive a wooden handle. It then became a complete hatchet.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"> [Pg 242]</a></span></p>
<p>Fig. 157 represents one of these hatchets fitted with a handle, in a
way similar to many of the specimens in the Museum of Saint-Germain.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 157.&mdash;Flint Hammer, fitted with a

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">This mode of insertion into a handle is frequently met with during
the polished-stone epoch, as we have already stated upon the authority
of Boucher de Perthes (see fig. 112).</p>

<p>There was also another way of adapting for use the stone chisels
and hammers. The following is the mode employed. The flint was
inserted into a short holder of stag's horn, hollowed out at one end
for this purpose, the other end of the piece of horn being cut square.
This squared end, which was thinner than the rest of the holder, was
fitted into a wooden handle, which had been perforated with a hole of
the same shape and size.</p>

<p>M. Desor, in his 'Mémoire sur les Palafittes,' supplies the following
sketch (fig. 158), as representing these double-handled hatchets.</p>

<div class="figcenter topspace2"><a name="i_305b.jpg" id="i_305b.jpg"></a>

<div class="caption">Fig. 158.&mdash;Stone Hatchet, with double Handle

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">It is very seldom that hatchets of this type are met with in a
complete state in the lacustrine habitations of Switzerland; the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"> [Pg 243]</a></span>
handles have generally disappeared. In other localities, where the
hatchets are very plentiful, very few holders are found. Is it not
the case that in these spots the stone was the special object of work
and not the handles? There were, in fact, in Switzerland, as in
France and Belgium, workshops devoted to the manufacture of these
articles. The large number of hatchets, either just commenced or
defective in workmanship, which have been found in some of the
principal lacustrine settlements leave no doubt on this point.</p>

<p>The finest and most carefully-wrought instruments are the
hammers and double, or hatchet-hammers. Most of them are made
of serpentine. One of the ends is generally rounded or flattened,
whilst the other tapers off either into a point or a cutting edge,
as represented in figs. 159 and 160, taken from M. Desor's work.
They are perforated with a round hole intended to receive a
handle of wood. This hole is so sharply and regularly cut out, that
it is difficult to believe it could have been made with nothing better
than a flint tool. Metal alone would appear to be capable of effecting
such finished work. This is one of the facts which tend to the idea
that the lacustrine settlements, which have been ascribed to the Stone
Age, belong rather to the bronze epoch.</p>

<p class="topspace2">The knives and saws have nothing remarkable about them. They
are mere flakes of flint, long and narrow in shape, the cutting edge
or teeth being on the widest side. There are some which are
fitted into handles of stag's horn, as represented in fig. 162, taken
from M. Desor's work.</p>

<p class="topspace2">They must have been fastened into the handles by means of bitumen,
for traces of this substance have been found on some of the handles.
The same plan was adopted in order to fix the hatchets in their holders.</p>

<p>The spear-heads (fig. 163) are very skilfully fashioned; their shape
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"> [Pg 245]</a></span>
is regular, and the chiselling very perfect, although inferior to that
observed in Denmark. They are made level on one side, and with a
longitudinal middle ridge on the other.</p>

<p class="topspace2">The cutting of these small objects must have required much labour
and skill. Some are toothed on the edges, which must have rendered
the wounds inflicted by them much more dangerous. The greater
part of these arrow-heads are made of flint, but some have been found
the material of which is bone, and even stag's horn.</p>

<p>The arrow-heads were fixed into the shafts by means of bitumen.
This plan is represented in figs. 165 and 166, which are given by M.
Mortillet in his 'Promenades préhistoriques à l'Exposition Universelle.'</p>

<p class="topspace2">A few relics have been discovered of the bows which were used to
impel these arrows. They were made of yew, and roughly cut.</p>

<p>Tools and instruments of bone seem, like those made of flint, to
have been much in use. In addition to the arrow-heads which we
have just mentioned, there have also been found piercers, or bodkins
of various shapes (figs. 168 and 169), chisels for working in wood
(fig. 170), pins with lenticular heads (fig. 171), needles perforated sometimes
with one eye and sometimes with two, and occasionally hollowed
out round the top in a circular groove, so as to attach the thread.</p>

<p>Figs. 168, 169, 170 and 171 are given by M. Desor in his

</div>

<p class="topspace2">It is probable that, as during the reindeer epoch, garments were
sewn by means of the needle and the bodkin, the latter piercing the
holes through which the needle passed the thread.</p>

<p>That kind of needle which has a hole in the middle and is pointed
at the two ends, which is found in large numbers in the lacustrine
settlements, must doubtless have been used as a hook for fishing.
When the fish had swallowed the bait, the two points stuck into the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"> [Pg 247]</a></span>
flesh, and it was then easy to pull out the captive. Some of these
fish-hooks are carved out of boars' tusks.</p>

<p>Stag's horn was likewise employed for several other purposes. A
kind of pick-axe was sometimes made of it (fig. 172); also harpoons
(fig. 173), harpoons with a double row of barbs (fig. 174), and small
cups of conical shape (fig. 175), perforated with a hole in the upper
part so that they could be suspended if required.</p>

<p class="topspace2">The taste for personal adornment was not foreign to the nature of
the primitive people of Switzerland. Canine teeth and incisors of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"> [Pg 248]</a></span>
various animals, rings and beads made of bone or stag's horn, all
united in a necklace, formed one of their most usual adornments.</p>

<p>They also made use of hair-pins and bone combs. These pins were
finished off with a knob, and combined elegance and simplicity in their
shape; they would, indeed, be no disfigurement to the <i>coiffure</i> of the
women of modern times.</p>

<p>Such were the instruments, utensils and tools, used for the purpose
of domestic life, which have been found in the lacustrine habitations of
Switzerland belonging to the Stone Age. We will now pass on to the
objects of the same character, peculiar to the bronze epoch.</p>

<p>The quantity of bronze objects which, up to the present time, have
been collected from the Swiss lakes is very considerable. The finest
collection in the country, that of Colonel Schwab, contained in 1867,
according to a catalogue drawn up by Dr. Keller, no less than 4346
specimens.</p>

<p>Most of these objects have been cast in moulds, as is evident from the
seams, the traces of which may be observed on several of the specimens.</p>

<p>Among the most remarkable of the relics of the bronze epoch which
have been recovered from the Swiss lakes, the hatchets or celts are
well deserving of mention. They are from 4 to 8 inches in length,
and weigh from 10 to 15 pounds. Their shapes are varied; but all
possess the distinctive characteristic of being adapted to fit longitudinally
on their handles, and not transversely, as in the Stone Age.
It is but seldom that they are not furnished with a hole or ear, so as
to furnish an additional means of attachment.</p>

<p>We have in the first place the hatchet with wings bent round on
each side of the blade, so as to constitute a kind of double socket,
intended to receive a handle divided in the middle and bent into an
elbow. This is the most prevalent type. Sometimes, as may be
noticed in fig. 176, the upper end is pierced with an eye, doubtless
intended to hold a band for fixing firmly the curved handle. This
arrangement is peculiar to the hatchets of large size, that is, to those
which had the most strain put upon them.</p>

<p>Another type which is very rare in Switzerland&mdash;only one specimen
of it existing in the Museum of Neuchâtel&mdash;is that (fig. 177) in which
the wings, instead of bending back upon the blade perpendicularly to
the plane of the cutting edge, turn back in the same plane with it, or
in the thickness of the blade.</p>

(fig. 178) or angular. This shape is very common in France, where
they are known by the name of <i>celts</i>.</p>

<p class="topspace2">M. Morlot has given the name of <i>knife-hatchets</i> (fig. 179), to those instruments,
the perforated ears of which are scarcely, if at all developed,
and could by no means serve to give firmness to a handle. It is probable
that these instruments were grasped directly by the hand; and that the
mere rudiments of wings which may be noticed, were merely intended
to substitute a rounded surface for a sharp ridge. Figures 176, 177,
178 and 179, are taken from M. Desor's 'Mémoire sur les Palafittes.'</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"> [Pg 250]</a></span></p>
<p>Next to the hatchets we must mention the chisels for wood-work
(fig. 180), which are cut out to a great nicety, and in no way differ
from our present chisels, except in the mode of fitting to the handle,
which is done by means of a socket.</p>

<p class="topspace2">There has also been discovered a kind of prismatically shaped
hexagonal hammer (fig. 181), likewise provided with a socket, the
length of which is about 3 inches. This hammer forms a portion of
the collection of Colonel Schwab.</p>

<p>The knives are the most numerous of all the sharp instruments.
The workmanship of them is, in general, very skilfully executed, and
their shape is very elegant. Some of them have a metallic handle;
but the greater part terminate in a kind of tang intended to fit into a
handle of wood or stag's horn, as represented in fig. 182, taken from
M. Desor's 'Mémoire sur les Palafittes.'</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"> [Pg 251]</a></span></p>
<p>We also find knives furnished with a socket (fig. 183). The blade
measures from 4 to 8 inches in length, and is often adorned with
tracings; in some instances the back of the blade is very much
thickened.</p>

<p class="topspace2">Together with the knives we must also class the sickles or reaping
hooks. These implements have been collected in somewhat large
quantities in the settlements of Auvernier and Cortaillod (Lake of
Neuchâtel). They are of good workmanship, and frequently provided
with ridges or ribs in the metal of the blade. Fig. 184, given by
M. Desor in his work, represents a sickle of this kind which was found
by the author at Chevroux.</p>

either at the end or some distance from the end, articles of fishing

<p class="topspace2">We shall dwell, although briefly, on the various objects of personal
ornament which have been found in the Swiss lacustrine settlements
of the bronze epoch.</p>

<p>We will mention, in the first place, the hair-pins, &amp;c. which have
been recovered from the various lakes. The most curious fact about
them is, that no one has ever found two exactly alike both in shape
and dimensions. We borrow from M. Desor's work the four following
figures representing various shapes of pins. Some have a round
head (fig. 187), and others a flat (fig. 188), or cylindrical head
(fig. 189); others, again, are finished off with a twisted end to
which is attached a movable end (fig. 190).</p>

<p class="topspace2">The round-headed pins are sometimes massive in shape and unornamented,
that is, exactly similar to the bone pins of the Stone Age;
sometimes, and even more frequently, they are perforated with one or
more round holes and adorned with a few chasings.</p>

<p>The flat-headed pins differ very much in the diameter of the button
at the end, which is sometimes of considerable size. There are some,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"> [Pg 253]</a></span>
the head of which is nothing more than a small enlargement of the
pin, and others, in which there are two or three of these enlargements,
placed a little way apart and separated by a twist. Their sizes are
very various, and in some cases are so exaggerated, that it is quite
evident that the objects cannot have been used as hair-pins. In
Colonel Schwab's collection, there is one 33 inches long, and M.
Troyon has mentioned some 20 and 24 inches long.</p>

<p>At the <i>Exposition Universelle</i> of 1867, in the collection sent by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"> [Pg 254]</a></span>
M. Desor, the visitors' admiration might have been called forth by some
of the pins which had been repolished by the care of the learned Swiss
naturalist. They were certainly very elegant, and ladies of the present
day might well have decorated themselves with these ornaments,
although they dated back to an era so many thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>Among many savage tribes, the dressing of the hair, especially
among the men, is carried to an excessively elaborate pitch. The
head of hair of an Abyssinian soldier forms a species of lofty system of
curls which is meant to last a whole lifetime. He carries with him
a long pin, furnished with a thick button, owing to the impossibility
of reaching his skin through his <i>coiffure</i> with the extremities of his
fingers.</p>

<p>In the same way the New Zealanders wear an enormous "chignon,"
2 feet high and ornamented with ribbons.</p>

<p>The Chinese and the Japanese also devote excessive attention to
the dressing of their hair.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, probable that the inhabitants of the lacustrine
villages, both men and women, devoted an immense amount of care
to the cultivation of their <i>coiffure</i>. In the tombs of the bronze
epoch, pins have been found 2&frac12; feet in length, with large knobs or
buttons at the end, similar to those used by the Abyssinian soldiers of
our own day. The combs, which resembled those of the present New
Zealanders, although 6 inches long, had only six to eight teeth, and must
have been better fitted to scratch their heads than to dress their hair.</p>

<p>Bracelets, too, have been found in some considerable numbers in
the Swiss lakes. They are very varied in their shapes, decidedly
artistic in their workmanship, and often set off with carved designs.</p>

<p>Some (fig. 191) are composed of a single ring of varying width,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"> [Pg 255]</a></span>
the ends of which almost meet and terminate by a semi-circular
clasp; others (fig. 192), are a combination of straight or twisted
wires ingeniously joined to one another.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 192.&mdash;Another Bronze Bracelet.

</div>

<p class="topspace2">We also find certain rings, cylindrical in shape, and made all in
one piece (fig. 193), which were probably placed round the legs.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 193.&mdash;Bronze Ring.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">Some of these ornaments remain, even up to the present day, in a
perfect state of preservation. In an urn which was recovered from
the settlement of Cortaillod, six specimens were discovered, the
designs of which appeared quite as clearly as if they had only just
been engraved. There is one point which must be remarked, because
it forms an important <i>datum</i> in respect to the size of the Swiss
people during the bronze epoch; this is, that most of the bracelets
are so small that they could scarcely be worn nowadays. They
must, therefore, have been adapted to very slender wrists&mdash;a fact
which naturally leads us to believe that all the other limbs were
small in proportion. This small size in the bracelets coincides with
the diminutiveness of the sword-hilts which have been found in the
lacustrine habitations of Switzerland.</p>

<p>Earrings, also, have been found in great numbers in the Swiss lakes.
They are either metallic plates, or wires differently fashioned; all,
however, testifying to a somewhat developed degree of taste.</p>

<p>Next after these trinkets and objects of adornment we must class
certain articles of a peculiar character which must have been pendants
or appendages to bracelets.</p>

<p>All these ornaments are, in fact, perforated at the top with a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"> [Pg 256]</a></span>
circular hole, intended, no doubt, to have a thread passed through it,
by which it was hung round the neck. Some of them (fig. 194)
are small triangular plates of metal, frequently ornamented with
engraved designs; others (fig. 195), are in open-work, and include
several branches, each terminated by a hole similar to that at the top.
Some, again, assume the form of a ring not completely closed up
(fig. 196), or rather, perhaps, of a crescent with wide and almost
contiguous horns. In the same class may be placed the rings
(fig. 197) to which were suspended movable ornaments in the shape
of a double spiral.</p>

<div class="chapsum">Industrial Skill and Agriculture during the Bronze Epoch&mdash;The Invention of Glass&mdash;Invention
of Weaving.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> manufacture of pottery, which appears to have remained
stationary during the Stone Age, assumed a considerable development
during the bronze epoch. The clay intended for making pottery
was duly puddled, and the objects when moulded were baked in
properly formed furnaces. At this date also commences the art of
surfacing articles of earthenware.</p>

<p>The specimens of pottery which have been found in the settlements
of man of this period are both numerous and interesting; entire
vessels have indeed been discovered. We notice indications of very
marked progress beyond the objects of this kind manufactured in the
preceding age. They are still fashioned by the hand and without
the aid of the wheel; but the shapes are both more varied in their
character and more elegant. In addition to this, although in the
larger kind of vessels the clay used is still rough in its nature and
full of hard lumps of quartz like the material employed in the Stone
Age, that of the smaller vessels is much finer, and frequently covered
with a black lead coating.</p>

<p>Most of these vessels are characterised by a conical base, a shape
which we had before occasion to point out in the stag's-horn vessels
of the Stone Age. If, therefore, it was requisite to place them upright,
the lower ends of them had to be stuck into the earth, or to
be placed in holders hollowed out to receive them.</p>

<p>Some of these supports, or holders, have been discovered. They
are called <i>torches</i>, or <i>torchères</i>, by French archæologists.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"> [Pg 259]</a></span></p>
<p>Figs. 198 and 199 give a representation of a bronze vessel

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">In a general way, the vessels made with conical bases have no
handles; but others, on the contrary, are provided with them
(fig. 200). They are nearly always ornamented with some sort of
design, either mere lines parallel to the rim, triangles, chevrons, or
rows of points round the handle or the neck. Even the very
roughest specimens are not altogether devoid of ornamentation, and a
stripe may often be observed round the neck, on which the fingers of
the potter have left their traces.</p>

alt="Earthen Vessel"  />
<div class="caption">Fig. 200.&mdash;Fragments of an Earthen Vessel
with a Handle.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">These vessels were intended to contain beverages and substances
used for food. Out of one of them M. Desor took some apples,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"> [Pg 260]</a></span>
cherries, wild plums, and a large quantity of nuts. Some of these
vessels, perforated with small holes, were used in the manufacture of
cheese. Dishes, porringers, &amp;c., have also been found.</p>

<p>Relics of the pottery of the Stone Age are very frequently recovered
from the Swiss lakes; but vessels in an entire state are seldom met
with. It is, however, stated as a fact, that considerable accumulations
of them once existed; but, unfortunately, the importance of them
was not recognised until too late. An old fisherman of the Lake of
Neuchâtel told M. Desor that in his childhood he had sometimes
amused himself by pushing at <i>these old earthen pots</i> with a long pole,
and that in certain parts of the lake there were <i>real mountains</i> of
them. At the present day, the "old earthen pots" are all broken,
and nothing but pieces can be recovered.</p>

<p>These relics are, however, sufficient to afford a tolerably exact idea
of the way in which the primitive Swiss used to fashion clay. They
seem to denote large vessels either cylindrical (figs. 201 and 202) or
bulbous-shaped with a flat bottom, moulded by the hand without the
aid of a potter's wheel. The material of which they are composed is
rough, and of a grey or black colour, and is always mingled with
small grains of quartz; the baking of the clay is far from satisfactory.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 202.&mdash;Vessel of Baked Clay, from the

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">The ornamentation is altogether of an ordinary character. It
generally consists of mere lines traced out in the soft clay, either by
the finger, a pointed stick, or sometimes a string was used. There
are neither curves nor arabesques of any kind; the lines are almost
always straight.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"> [Pg 261]</a></span></p>
<p>A few of the vessels are, however, decorated in a somewhat better
style. Some are provided with small projections perforated with holes,
through which might be passed a string for the purpose of hanging
them up; there are others which have a row of studs arranged all
round them, just below the rim, and others, indeed, in which hollows
take the place of the studs. Several have been met with which are
pierced with holes at different heights; it is supposed that they were
used in the preparation of milk-curd, the holes being made to let out
the whey. The vessels of this period are entirely devoid of handles;
this ornament did not appear until the bronze age.</p>

<p>Mill-stones, or stones for crushing grain, are not unfrequently found
in the Swiss lakes.</p>

<p>At some date during the period we are now discussing we must
place the discovery of glass. Glass beads of a blue or green colour
are, in fact, found in the tombs of the bronze epoch. What was their
origin? Chemistry and metallurgy combine to inform us that as
soon as bronze foundries existed glass must have been discovered.
What, in fact, does glass consist of? A silicate with a basis of soda
and potash, combined with some particles of the silicates of iron and
copper, which coloured it blue and green. As the scoria from bronze
foundries is partly composed of these silicates it is indubitable that
a kind of glass was formed in the earliest metal-works where this alloy
was made. It constituted the slag or dross of the metal works.</p>

<p>Thus, the classic tradition which attributes the invention of glass
to certain Ph&#339;nician merchants, who produced a mass of glass by
heating on the sand the <i>natron</i>, that is <i>soda</i>, brought from Egypt,
ascribe too recent a date to the discovery of this substance. It should
properly be carried back to the bronze epoch.</p>

<p>The working of amber was carried out to a very great extent
by these peoples. Ornaments and objects of this material have
been discovered in great abundance in the lacustrine settlements of
Switzerland.</p>

<p>On the whole, if we compare the industrial skill of the bronze age
with that of the preceding age, we shall find that the later is vastly
superior to the earlier.</p>

<p>The art of weaving seems to have been invented during the stone
age. We have positive and indisputable proofs that the people who
lived during this epoch were acquainted with the art of manufacturing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"> [Pg 262]</a></span>
cloth.<a name="fnanchor_36"
id="fnanchor_36"></a><a href="#footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
All the objects which we have thus far considered do not, in
fact, surpass those which might be expected from any intelligent
savage; but the art of preparing and manufacturing textile fabrics
marks out one of the earliest acquisitions of man's civilisation.</p>

<p>In the Museum of Saint-Germain we may both see and handle some
specimens of woven cloth which were met with in some of the
lacustrine settlements in Switzerland, and specially at Robenhausen
and Wangen. This cloth, which is represented in fig. 203, taken
from a specimen in the Museum of Saint-Germain, is formed of twists
of interwoven flax; of rough workmanship, it is true, but none the less
remarkable, considering the epoch in which it was manufactured. It
is owing to the fact of their having been charred and buried in the
peat that these remains of pre-historic fabrics have been kept in good
preservation up to the present time.</p>

<p class="topspace2">Balls of thread and twine have also been found; likewise ends of
cord, and ropes made of bark, nets with large and moderately-sized
meshes, which we have previously represented, and lastly some fragments
of a basket of straw or osier.</p>

<p>Ribs of animals, split through and tapering off at one end, have
been considered to be the teeth of the cards or combs which were
used for unravelling the flax. The whole comb was formed of several
of these bones joined firmly together with a band.</p>

<p class="topspace2">There were also found in the Swiss lakes a large number of discs
made of baked earth perforated with a hole in their centre, of which we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"> [Pg 263]</a></span>
here give a representation (fig. 205), taken from one of the numerous
specimens in the Museum of Saint-Germain. These are ordinary
spindle-whorls.</p>

alt="Spindle-whorls"  />
<div class="caption">Fig. 205.&mdash;Spindle-whorls made of baked Clay,
found in the Lacustrine Settlements of Switzerland.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">Also, terra cotta weights pierced with a hole through the centre
were intended to support the thread of flax in the weaving loom. The
thread passed through the hole and was stopped by a knot at its extremity.
We think that this interpretation of the use of these
objects can hardly be called in question.</p>

<p>We also find in the lacustrine settlements woven fabrics, threads,
strings, combs used for carding the flax, and spindle-whorls; the co-existence
of all these objects proves that the invention of the art of
weaving may be fixed at this date. The loom of the weaver may,
therefore, be traced back to the most remote ages.</p>

<p>Acting upon this idea we have given a representation of <i>weaving
in pre-historic times</i>.</p>

<p>The weaving-loom is so simple a matter that the men of the bronze
age were enabled to produce it in nearly the same form as that in
which it exists in the present day for the manufacture of plain kinds
of cloth in various districts of the world where the art is still in
a barbaric condition. The loom being upright, not horizontal as
with us, the terra cotta weights just mentioned were used to keep
the threads of the warp stretched. This seems to be the only difference.
But, as we again repeat, the weaver's loom, on the whole, must
have differed but very slightly from that of the present day. Its
productions bear testimony to the fact.</p>

<p>Metal weapons and implements were at first obtained by means of
exchange. But very soon the art of manufacturing bronze became
prevalent in Switzerland, and foundries were established there. No
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"> [Pg 264]</a></span>
doubt can be entertained on this point, as a mould for celts or hatchets
has been found at Morges and also a bar of tin at Estavayer.</p>

<p>During this epoch the shape of the pottery became more advanced
in character, and ornamentation was the rule and not the exception.
After the indispensable comes the superfluous. Taste in ornamentation
made its appearance and soon developed itself in ceramic objects
of an elegant style. Articles of pottery now assumed more pleasing
outlines, and were ornamented with various designs. Progress in
artistic feeling was evidently manifested.</p>

<p>The simplicity and monotony of ornamentation during this epoch
is especially remarkable. Art was then confined to the mere representation
of a certain number of lines and geometrical figures. They
were similar to those represented in fig. 206, and were applied to all
kinds of objects&mdash;weapons, vases, utensils and trinkets. None of
them attempt any delineation of nature; this idea does not seem to
have entered into the head of man during the bronze epoch. In this
respect they were inferior to their predecessors, the inhabitants of the
caves of Périgord, the contemporaries of the mammoth and the
reindeer.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 206.&mdash;Principal Designs for the

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">During the period we are now considering, commercial intercourse
had assumed an activity of a totally different character from that
manifested during the Stone Age. It became necessary to procure tin,
which was indispensable for the manufacture of bronze. As no tin
ore could be found in Switzerland, the inhabitants, doubtless, went to
Saxony in order to obtain it. The traffic must have been carried out
by means of barter, as is customary among all infant nations.</p>

<p>Flint, which likewise did not exist in Switzerland, was necessarily
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"> [Pg 265]</a></span>
procured from the surrounding countries which were more fortunate
in this respect. No country was more favoured on this point than
France; commerce must, therefore, have existed between the two
countries.</p>

<p>At Concise, in Switzerland, some pieces of white coral were found,
and at Meilen, on the banks of the Lake of Zurich, some fragments
of amber; from this we may conclude that during the bronze epoch
the inhabitants of Switzerland traded with the inhabitants of the
shores of the Mediterranean and the Baltic.</p>

<p>Among the other specimens of foreign productions, we must not
omit to mention graphite, which was used to surface pottery, amber
beads, and even a few glass trinkets suitable for female adornment.</p>

<p>We will now pass on to the system of food adopted by man during
the bronze epoch.</p>

<p>Researches made in various lacustrine settlements have furnished
us with very circumstantial information upon the system of food
customary among the earliest inhabitants of Switzerland. From
them we learn that these men did not live solely upon the products of
fishing and hunting, but that they possessed certain ideas of agriculture,
and also devoted themselves to the breeding of cattle. We shall
enter into a few details as to this eminently interesting aspect of their
history, taking as our guides Professors Heer and Rütimeyer, the first
of whom has carefully examined the vegetable remains, and the second
the animal relics which have been found in the lacustrine settlements
of Switzerland.</p>

<p>At Meilen, Moosseedorf, and Wangen, some charred cereals have
been found, viz., barley and wheat. The latter was the most abundant,
and, at Wangen in particular, there were several bushels of it, either
in ears or in thrashed corn collected in large heaps. These grains
are almost the same shape and size as the wheat of the present time.
Several ears of six-rowed barley (<i>Hordeum hexastichon</i>) were found,
which differ from our common barley in having smaller grains
arranged in six rows. De Candolle is of opinion that this is the
species which was cultivated by the ancient Greeks, Egyptians, and
Romans.</p>

<p>This corn was preserved in large earthen vessels, as may be
gathered from the contents of some of them, still in an entire state.</p>

<p>What preparation did the corn undergo in order to render it fit for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"> [Pg 266]</a></span>
human food? On this subject we have tolerably exact data to go
upon.</p>

<p>The grain was bruised by hand, either between two stone discs or
mill-stones, or in a mortar by means of a round pestle. In almost all
of the lacustrine villages, some of these mill-stones made of granite or
sandstone have been met with, a few of which are as much as 2 feet
in diameter. M. Heer is of opinion that the grain was parched before
being pounded, and then placed in vessels and slightly soaked. In
this state it was fit for eating.</p>

<p>At the time of the conquest of the Canary Islands by the Spaniards,
it was remarked that the natives prepared their corn in this manner;
and in the present day the inhabitants of the same regions still feed
on parched grain.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the earliest inhabitants of western Switzerland also
made real bread, or rather wheat-cakes, for leaven was not then
known. Charred fragments of these loaves have been found, the grain
of which is badly ground, thus affording us the opportunity of recognising
the species of corn of which they are composed. These
fragments are flat, and indicate that the whole cake was of a circular
form. No doubt, after being bruised and wetted, the grain was made
into a sort of dough, which was baked between two heated stones&mdash;a
process we have previously described as having been practised in the
Stone Age.</p>

<p>In order to cultivate cereals, it was, of course, necessary for the
ground to undergo some preliminary preparation. It was at least
necessary to break it up so as to mellow it, and to make furrows in
which to sow the seed. We are reduced to mere conjecture as to all
the details of these operations, for no agricultural implements have
been discovered in any of the settlements of man belonging to the
bronze epoch. Perhaps, as M. Heer suggests, they made use of the
stem of a tree with a projecting crooked branch, and adapted it so as
to perform the functions of the plough.</p>

<p>Wild fruits and berries formed a considerable portion of the food of
the earliest lacustrine peoples; and, from certain indications which
have been brought to our notice, we have reason to believe that several
varieties of trees were the objects of their intelligent culture; in
short, that they were cultivated in orchards and gardens. The settlement
of Robenhausen on the Lake of Pfæffikon, has furnished us with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"> [Pg 267]</a></span>
the most valuable information on this point. The lacustrine villages
of Wangen (Lake of Constance), and Concise (Lake of Neuchâtel)
have also been the scenes of curious discoveries.</p>

<p>In all of these settlements a large number of charred apples have
been met with, cut in two, and sometimes four pieces, and evidently
stored up for the winter. These apples are no larger than walnuts,
and in many of the Swiss forests a species of apple still exists which
appears to be the same sort as those found in the lacustrine settlements.
Pears have been discovered only in the settlement of Wangen;
they were cut up and dried just like the apples.</p>

<p>In the mud of the lakes, stones of the wild plum and the bird-cherry,
or Sainte-Lucie plum, were found; also the seeds of blackberries
and raspberries, the shells of beech-nuts and hazel-nuts, and several
species of the water-chestnut, which is now only to be met with at two
points of the Swiss Alps.</p>

<p>We must also add that M. Gilliéron collected in the settlement of
the Isle of Saint-Pierre, oats, peas, lentils, and acorns, the latter
evidently having been intended for the food of swine. This discovery
is an important one, because oats had, hitherto, never been met with
anywhere.</p>

<p>We shall complete this list of names by enumerating the other
vegetables which have been ascertained to have existed in the lake
settlements, the berries and seeds of some of which were used as food,
&amp;c. They are the strawberry, the beech, the yew, the dog-rose,
which is found in hedges, the white and yellow water-lily, the rush,
and the forest and the marsh pine. There are no traces of the vine,
rye, or hemp.</p>

<p>Fig. 207, representing <i>the cultivation of gardens during the bronze

we have previously suggested concerning the agricultural and horticultural
knowledge possessed by man during the bronze epoch. A
gardener is tilling the ground with a horn pick-axe, a representation
of which we have previously given. Others are gathering fruit
from trees which have been planted and cultivated with a view of
increasing the stock of food.</p>

<p class="topspace2">The sheep and oxen which may be noticed in this figure indicate
the domestication of these animals and of their having been reared as
tame cattle. The dog, the faithful companion of man, could scarcely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"> [Pg 268]</a></span>
have been omitted in this assemblage of the auxiliary or domestic
animals of the bronze epoch.</p>

<p>The bones which have been found in the lacustrine settlements of
Switzerland have enabled us to reconstruct with some degree of accuracy
the <i>fauna</i> of this epoch, and to ascertain what species of animals
were then in subjugation to the yoke of man.</p>

<p>Professor Rütimeyer is of opinion that the whole of these bones
may be referred to about seventy species of animals&mdash;ten of which are
fish, three reptiles, twenty birds, and the rest mammiferous animals.</p>

<p>The remains most commonly met with are those of the stag and the
ox, the former wild, and the latter domestic. Next in order comes the
pig, remains of which are also very abundant; then follows the roe,
the goat, and the sheep, all of which are much less common. The
remains of the fox are met with almost as often as those of the latter
species, and in spite of the f&#339;tid smell of this animal it certainly was
used for food&mdash;a fact which is proved by its bones having been split
open and notched with knives. It is, however, very probable that this
kind of sustenance was turned to as a last resort only in cases when
no other more suitable food could be obtained.</p>

<p>The long bones which have been found in lakes, like those met
with in caves and kitchen-middens, have been split in order to extract
the marrow. Just as in the kitchen-middens, the softer parts are
always gnawed, which shows us that the dog had been there.</p>

<p>The repugnance which is felt by so many nations for the flesh of
the hare is a very curious fact, and shows us how difficult it is to
root out certain prejudices. This repugnance may be traced back as
far as pre-historic ages. Neither the diluvial beds, the caves, the
kitchen-middens, nor the lacustrine settlements have, in fact, furnished
us with any traces of the hare. Even in the present day, the Laplanders
and Greenlanders banish this animal from their alimental
list.</p>

<p>Among the Hottentots the women eat it but not the men. The
Jews, too, look upon it as unclean, and many years have not elapsed
since the Bretons would hardly endure to hear it spoken of.</p>

<p>The antipathy which is thus shown by certain modern nations to
the flesh of the hare has, therefore, been handed down to them from
the primitive ages of mankind.</p>

<p>The researches of Prof. Rütimeyer have led to the conclusion that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"> [Pg 269]</a></span>
there existed in Switzerland during the Stone Age six species of
domestic animals&mdash;the ox, the pig, the goat, the sheep, the dog, and
the horse, the latter being very rare. There were, also, three specimens
of the bovine race; the two wild species of the ox genus, namely,
the urus and the bison, both very anciently known, had been increased
by a third, the domestic ox.</p>

<p>The bones belonging to the Stone Age seem to point to the existence
of a larger proportion of wild beasts than of domestic animals; and
this is only what might be expected, for the art of domesticating
animals was at this epoch still in its infancy, but a commencement
had been made, and the practice continued to spread rapidly during
the following age.</p>

<p>In fact, agriculture and the breeding of cattle made considerable progress
during the bronze epoch. There were brought into use various
new breeds of cattle. The ox became a substitute for the bison; the
sheep was bred as well as the goat; and all these animals were
devoted to the purpose of providing food for man.</p>

</div>

<p class="topspace2">We may here pause for a moment and contemplate, with just pride,
this marvellous resuscitation of an era long ago buried in the darkness
of bygone ages.</p>

<p>By means of the investigations of science, we know that the primitive
inhabitants of Switzerland dwelt in wooden villages built on
lakes; that they were hunters, fishers, shepherds, and husbandmen;
that they cultivated wheat, barley, and oats; that they brought into
a state of servitude several species of animals, and devoted to the requirements
of agriculture the sheep and the goat; that they were
acquainted with the principal rudiments of the baker's art; that
they stored up apples, pears, and other fruits or berries for the
winter, either for their own use or that of their cattle; that they
understood the art of weaving and manufacturing flaxen fabrics;
that they twisted up cord and mats of bark; and, lastly, that as
a material for the manufacture of their implements and weapons
they availed themselves of stone, bronze, animals' bones, and stag's
horn.</p>

<p>It is equally certain that they kept up some kind of commercial
intercourse with the adjacent countries; this must have been the case,
if it were only for the purpose, as before mentioned, of procuring
flints, which are not found in Switzerland; also amber and white
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"> [Pg 270]</a></span>
coral, numerous relics of which have been met with in the settlements
of Meilen and Concise.</p>

<p>Though there may still remain many an obscure page in the
history of mankind during the bronze epoch, it must, nevertheless, be
confessed that, as far as Switzerland is concerned, a bright light has
of late years been thrown on that branch of the subject which refers
to man's mode of existence in these regions during the bronze epoch.</p>

<div class="chapsum">The Art of War during the Bronze Epoch&mdash;Swords, Spears, and Daggers&mdash;The
Bronze Epoch in Scandinavia, in the British Isles, France, Switzerland, and Italy&mdash;Did
the Man of the Bronze Epoch entertain any religious or superstitious
Belief?</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Swiss lakes have furnished us with elements which afford us
some knowledge of the state of man's industrial skill during the
bronze epoch, and also enable us to form a due estimation of the
manners and customs of the people of these remote ages. But if we
wish to become acquainted with all the details which concern the art
of war at the same date, we must direct our attention to the north of
Europe, that is to say, to the Scandinavian peoples.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, before we touch upon the important pre-historic relics
found in Denmark, we must say a few words concerning the traces of
the art of war which have been furnished by the investigations made
in the Swiss lakes.</p>

<p>The warlike accoutrements of the bronze epoch are, like those of
the Stone Age, composed of spear-heads and arrow-heads, poniards and,
in addition, swords. Swords are, however, but rarely met with in the
Swiss lakes. The few which have been found are straight, short,
double-edged, and without hilts. In the Museum of Neuchâtel there
is a sword (fig. 209) which was discovered forty years ago at Concise,
at a time when no one suspected the existence of any such thing as
lacustrine settlements; M. Desor has supplied a sketch of it in his
'Mémoire sur les Palafittes.' This sword measures 16 inches in length,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"> [Pg 272]</a></span>
and has on its surface four grooves which join together on the middle
ridge of the blade. The handle, which is terminated by a double
volute, is remarkably small, being only 3 inches in length.</p>

<p>Daggers (fig. 210), too, like the swords, are but rarely found in the
Swiss lakes. From a specimen found in the lake of Bienne, we see that
the blade was fixed to the handle by means of a series of rivets arranged
in a single line. This dagger is, like the sword found at Concise,
ornamented with grooves symmetrically placed on each side of the
projecting ridge which divides the blade into two equal portions.</p>

<p class="topspace2">In the collection of Colonel Schwab, there are two daggers of an
extraordinary character, having hilts enriched with silver.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"> [Pg 273]</a></span></p>
<p>The spear-heads (fig. 211) are not inferior either to the swords or
the daggers in the skill and finish of their workmanship. They are
formed of a nearly oval blade, strongly consolidated in the middle by
a rounded ridge, which is prolonged so as to form a socket intended to
hold a thick wooden handle. The length of the daggers varies from
4 to 7 inches.</p>

<p class="topspace2">The arrow-heads (fig. 212) are, except in their material, identical
with those of the preceding age. They are triangular, with more or
less pointed barbs, and provided with a stem, by which they were
fastened to the stick. A few have, however, been found which are
made with sockets. They do not exceed 1 to 2 inches in length.</p>

<p class="topspace2">We shall now pass on to the consideration of the relics found in the
tombs of Scandinavia, Great Britain, Ireland and France; which
remains will throw some light on the subject of the weapons and
warlike instruments belonging to the bronze epoch.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian States (Denmark, Sweden, and Norway) are very
rich in instruments belonging to the bronze epoch. The workmanship
of the swords and other weapons of war is much more elaborate
here than anywhere else, on account of the tardy introduction of metal
into these countries. These weapons are nearly always adorned with
somewhat complicated designs, among which curved lines and spiral
scrolls are the most prevalent.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"> [Pg 274]</a></span></p>
<p>The Danish swords of the bronze epoch (figs. 213, 214) are of
quite a peculiar shape. The hilt is firmly fixed to the blade by means
of two or more rivets. The daggers and poniards only differ from
the swords in the smallness of their dimensions.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 214.&mdash;Hilt of a Scandinavian Sword.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">Some of the hatchets seem to have been copied from models
belonging to the Stone Age; these are probably the most ancient,
and their ornamentation is of a very scanty character. Others are
winged or with sockets, and a few have been found perforated with a
transverse hole, like those which have long been used by civilised
nations. In this hole a wooden handle was inserted, which was fixed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"> [Pg 275]</a></span>
by means of a strap, or merely forcibly driven in. The rarely-found
specimens of this kind are sharply defined in shape and splendidly
ornamented.</p>

<p>Figs. 215 and 216, taken from Sir J. Lubbock's work, represent
the probable way in which handles were fitted to the various kinds of
hatchets used in the North.</p>

<p class="topspace2">The blades of the bronze knives found in Scandinavia are, like those
of Switzerland, somewhat curved in their shape, but the handles are
much more richly ornamented. Two of these knives have furnished
us with the only examples known of any representation of living
beings during the bronze epoch. We may notice that on one of
these knives, which is represented in fig. 217, taken from Sir J.
Lubbock's work, a swan is roughly carved at the offset of the blade.</p>

</div>

<p class="topspace2">In another knife, which is represented in fig. 218, taken from the
same work, the handle is formed by a human figure, executed with some
degree of fidelity. The figure is in a standing position, and holds in
front of it a nearly cylindrical-shaped vessel; the individual is represented
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"> [Pg 276]</a></span>
as wearing large earrings. There is every reason to believe that
this last-mentioned article belongs to the end of the bronze epoch, or
else to a transitionary epoch between this and the following, for the
blade is straight, like those of all the knives belonging to the
iron age.</p>

<p class="topspace2">The same thing may, doubtless, be said of several razors (fig. 219)
with straight blades, which appear even overloaded with ornaments;
among these embellishments is an attempt to represent a sort of
vessel.</p>

<p class="topspace2">These designs evidently point to some very advanced period in the
bronze epoch; and perhaps these objects may belong to the commencement
of the iron age.</p>

<p>What, we may ask, was the wearing apparel of man during the
period we are describing?</p>

<p>A very important discovery, made in 1861, in a <i>tumulus</i> in Jutland
(Denmark), has lately supplied us with the most accurate <i>data</i> respecting
the way in which the inhabitants of the north of Europe were
clothed during the bronze epoch. In this <i>tumulus</i> MM. Worsaae,
and Herbst found three wooden coffins, one of which was smaller than
the two others, and was no doubt that of a child. One of the two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"> [Pg 277]</a></span>
larger coffins was minutely examined by these <i>savants</i>, and measured
inside 7 feet in length and 20 inches in width. It was closed up by
means of a movable lid. By an extremely rare chance the soft parts
of the body had been to some extent preserved, and had become
converted into a black greasy substance. The bones were decomposed,
and had decayed into a kind of blue powder. The brain had
preserved its normal conformation. They found it at one end of
the coffin (where the head had lain); it was still covered with a
woollen cap, about 6 inches high, to which several black hairs were
adhering.</p>

<p>Several woollen garments, in which the body had been buried, were
also found in different parts of the coffin. We add a description of
these garments.</p>

<p>There was in the first place a coarse cloak (fig. 220) which
appeared shaggy in the inside, and was scalloped out round the neck.
This cloak was 3 feet 4 inches long, and wide in proportion. Next
there were two shawls nearly square in shape (fig. 221), ornamented
with a long fringe, and measuring 4&frac12; feet in length, and 3&frac12; feet
in width. Afterwards came a shirt (fig. 222), also scalloped out
round the neck, and drawn in at the waist by means of a long narrow
band. Lastly, at the feet of the body, two pieces of woollen material
were found, which were 14 inches long, by 4 inches wide, and bore the
appearance of having been the remains of gaiters. Close to the latter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"> [Pg 278]</a></span>
were also found vestiges of leather, evidently belonging to feet-coverings
of some kind.</p>

<p class="topspace2">The whole body had been wrapped up in the skin of an ox.</p>

<p>The coffin also contained a box, tied up with strips of osier or bark,
and in this box was a smaller one, in which were found two woven
woollen caps (fig. 223, 224), a comb (fig. 225), and a bronze razor.</p>

<p class="topspace2">We must not forget to mention a bronze sword, placed on the left
side of the body, in a wooden sheath; this sword measured about
26 inches in length.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that all these relics were those of a warrior of
the bronze epoch; there is the less reason to doubt this, owing to the
fact, that the objects taken from the two other coffins most certainly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"> [Pg 279]</a></span>
belonged to that period. These were a sword, a knife, a bodkin, an
awl, a pair of tweezers, a double button, and a small bronze bracelet;
also a double tin button, a ball of amber and a flint spear-head.</p>

</div>

<p class="topspace2">The shape of the swords and knives shows that this burial-place in
Jutland must be referred to the latter part of the bronze epoch&mdash;to a
time, perhaps, when iron was first used.</p>

<p>Following out the <i>data</i> afforded by these records, and all the discoveries
which have been made in other tombs, we have given in fig.
226, a representation of <i>warriors of the bronze epoch</i>.</p>

<p>The accoutrements of the horseman of pre-historic ages are composed
of a bronze sword, like those found in the tombs in Denmark,
and a bronze hatchet and sword-belt. His horse is decked with
round bronze discs, which, in after times, formed among the Romans
the chief ornament of this faithful and intrepid auxiliary of man in
all his combats. The horseman's head is bare; for no helmet or
metallic head-covering has ever, at least, to our knowledge, been
discovered in the tombs of the bronze epoch. The spear and bronze
hatchet are the weapons of the foot-soldiers.</p>

<p>Next to the Scandinavian regions, Great Britain and Ireland occupy
an important place in the history of the civilisation of the bronze
epoch. The same type of implements are found in these countries as
in Denmark and Switzerland.</p>

<p>Hatchet-moulds (fig. 227) are also found there&mdash;a circumstance
which proves that the founder's art was known and practised in these
countries. The Dublin Museum contains a beautiful collection of
various objects belonging to the bronze epoch.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"> [Pg 280]</a></span></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">Some of the departments of France have also furnished objects
belonging to the same period; but there is nothing peculiar among
them which deserves mention.</p>

<p>Did any kind of religious worship exist among the men of the
bronze epoch? Nothing would be more interesting than any discovery
bearing on this point; but up to the present time no vestiges of anything
in the shape of an idol have been found, nor anything whatever
which authorizes us unhesitatingly to answer this question in the
affirmative. The only thing which might prove the existence of any
religious feeling, is the discovery, in various lacustrine settlements, of
a certain number of crescent-shaped objects, most of them made of very
coarse baked earth and some of stone.</p>

<p>The dimensions of these crescents vary considerably; there are some
which measure as much as 16 inches from one point to the other.
They are ornamented with perfectly primitive designs, as shown in
fig. 228, drawn at the Museum of Saint-Germain from one of the
numerous specimens of this class of objects.</p>

alt="Stone Crescent"  />
<div class="caption">Fig. 228.&mdash;Stone Crescent found in one of
the Swiss Lakes
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">Several archæologists consider these crescents to have been religious
emblems or talismans which were suspended either outside or inside
the habitations. Dr. Keller is of opinion that they bear some relation
to the worship of the moon&mdash;an hypothesis which is not at all
an impossible one; for all nations who have not attained to a certain
degree of moral and intellectual culture adore the heavenly bodies as
the sources of light and heat.</p>

<p>M. Carl Vogt, in considering the crescents which have been discovered
in such large quantities in the lacustrine habitations, cannot
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"> [Pg 281]</a></span>
admit that they indicate that any religious belief existed among these
ancient nations. He attributes to these objects a very different kind
of use, and, as we shall presently show, rather an odd one.</p>

<p>In the lectures on <i>pre-historic man</i> which were delivered by
Prof. Carl Vogt at Antwerp, in 1868, and have been reported by the
Belgian journals,<a name="fnanchor_37"
id="fnanchor_37"></a><a href="#footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> when speaking on the subject of the crescents
belonging to the bronze epoch, he expresses himself as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My opinion is that these crescents were used as resting-places for
the head during the night. Among many savage tribes we find the
attention paid to the dressing of the hair carried to a high pitch,
especially among the men; it was not until a later period that woman
also devoted her cares to the culture of her <i>coiffure</i>. Now this care
is, by many nations, carried out to a really curious extent. They inflict
the most severe tortures on themselves in order to satisfy their vanity.
Everyone has seen, in the 'Magasin Pittoresque' and other illustrated
journals, the strange head-dresses of the Abyssinian soldiers. They
really seem to form a kind of fleece, and it may be noticed that each
soldier carries in this hairy construction a large pin.</p>

<p>"Well, all this tends to explain the use of these crescents. In
Abyssinia, as soon as a young girl is married it becomes her duty to
devote herself to her husband's head of hair. This head of hair is
made to assume a certain shape, which it has to retain during his
whole lifetime. The labour which this process necessitates lasts for
three years. Each hair is twisted round a stem of straw, and remains
so until the straw perishes. The man's head is thus covered with a
whole system of spirals, the top of which is a foot from the surface of
his head. During the whole remainder of his life this <i>coiffure</i> must
never be again disturbed. When asleep, the Abyssinian rests the
nape of his neck on a triangle which he carries about everywhere with
him. He has also a long pin, as it would be impossible for him to
reach the skin of his head with the end of his finger.</p>

<p>"The same custom exists among the New Zealanders, who also
have an apparatus upon which they rest their necks, in order, when
asleep, to save their <i>coiffures</i>. They wear an enormous chignon, two
feet high and ornamented with ribbons, of which they are very proud.
The only difference between this chignon and certain others which
I need not mention is, that the former cannot be removed at will.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"> [Pg 282]</a></span>
This object, thus adorned, rests, during the sleep of its owner, on a
sort of framework.</p>

<p>"The Chinese and Japanese sleep, in the same way, on a bedstead
bevelled off at the head; and in the Egyptian hieroglyphical drawings
we find instruments evidently meant for the same use.</p>

<p>"It is very probable that during the bronze epoch great attention
was devoted to the hair, and this is the more probable as in every
tomb belonging to this period we find pins from 2 feet to 2&frac12; feet in
length, furnished with large knobs, and of the same shape as the pins
used by the Abyssinian soldiers; and also, because during the Stone
Age, as well as the Bronze Age, a kind of comb is found which is
similar to that which is now used by the New Zealanders to scratch,
rather than to comb, their heads. The heads of the pins are often
very richly ornamented; they are of the most varied shapes, and
are extremely common both in the tombs and also in the lacustrine
dwellings.</p>

<p>"We have the less right to be astonished at our ancestors sleeping
with their heads resting on such a machine as we have just described,
knowing, as we do, that the hussars of Frederick the Great used to
spend the whole night in arranging their <i>coiffures</i>!"</p>

<p>Thus, while Dr. Keller and many other archæologists ascribe the
<i>crescents</i> found in the Swiss lakes to some kind of religious worship,
M. Vogt, whose idea is of a much more prosaic character, does not
attribute them to any other worship but that of <i>self</i> as represented by
the hair! The reader can take his choice between these two explanations.
We shall only remark, in corroboration of Dr. Keller's
opinion, that certain Gallic tribes used for a religious symbol this very
crescent which M. Vogt would make out to be a pillow&mdash;a stone
pillow which, as it seems to us, must have been very hard, even for
primitive man.</p>

<p>Various objects found in the dwellings of man belonging to the
bronze epoch appear to have been religious symbols. Such, for
instance, are the designs so often met with on swords, vases, &amp;c.
These drawings never represent objects in nature; they seem rather
to be cabalistic signs or talismans. Most of them bear some relation
to a circle; sometimes they are single circles, and sometimes combinations
of circles. Many authors have had the idea of attributing
them to the worship of the sun.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"> [Pg 283]</a></span></p>
<p>Another sign was still more often used, and it was known even as
early as the Stone Age&mdash;we speak of the cross. It is one of the most
ancient symbols that ever existed. M. G. de Mortillet, in a work
entitled 'La Croix avant le Christianisme,' has endeavoured to establish
the fact, that the cross has always been the symbol of a sect
which contended against fetishism. This much is at least certain,
that it is one of the most ancient symbolical signs; for it is found
depicted on objects belonging to the Stone Age, and on some of
the earliest relics of the Bronze Age. At the time of the Etruscans
the cross was generally prevalent as a sign. But at a later period
Christianity exclusively monopolized this religious symbol.</p>

<p>A third figure is sometimes found on various objects belonging to
the bronze epoch; this figure is the triangle.</p>

<p>It is, on the whole, very probable that all these signs which are
not connected with any known object, bear some relation to certain
religious or superstitious ideas entertained by the men of the bronze
epoch; and, as a consequence of this, that their hearts must have been
inspired with some degree of religious feeling.</p>

<div class="chapsum">Mode of Interment and Burial-places of the Bronze Epoch&mdash;Characteristics of the
Human Race during the same Period.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> question naturally arises&mdash;what was the mode of interment,
and what was the nature of the burial-places employed by man
during the bronze epoch?</p>

<p>In the early part of this period the dead were still buried in those
sepulchral chambers which are now called by the name of <i>dolmens</i>;
Nilsson and Lubbock have drawn somewhat confused and arbitrary
distinctions in discussing these burial-places; but it may be positively
asserted that towards the conclusion of this period the practice of
burning dead bodies was commenced.</p>

<p>In a work, published in 1869, and entitled 'Le Danemark à l'Exposition
Universelle,' being a sort of catalogue of the objects which
were exhibited in the galleries devoted to the <i>History of Labour</i>, in
the Exhibition in the Champ de Mars, in 1867, we find several pages
which we shall quote, as they seem to recapitulate pretty clearly the
ideas which are now current among scientific men concerning the
burial-places and funeral customs of the bronze epoch:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The study which, during the last few years, has been devoted by
M. Worsaae to the tombs belonging to the bronze epoch, has thrown
much light," says M. Valdemar Schmidt, "on the commencement of
the bronze age in Denmark. It appears that at the first beginning
of the bronze epoch the dead were buried in a manner similar to
that practised during the stone age, that is to say, the bodies of the
defunct were deposited in sepulchral chambers made of stone, and
covered by <i>tumuli</i>; the only difference is, these chambers are rather
small, and generally contain but one skeleton. But to make up for
this, several of these small sepulchral chambers, or rather stone
coffins, are sometimes found in the same <i>tumulus</i>.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"> [Pg 285]</a></span></p>
<p>"These chambers present, however, in some respects, great similarities
with those of the Stone Age; thus, beds of flint which have been
subjected to the action of fire are often found spread over the
ground, and on these beds skeletons are met with which appear to
have been placed in a contracted position before they were buried,
exactly following the practice of the Stone Age.</p>

<p>"After this class of tombs, we have another, in which the sepulchral
chamber, though always made of stone, is not covered with a stone
slab but with a <i>wooden roof</i>. Elsewhere, skeletons have been found
along with bronze weapons deposited in a sort of <i>wooden framework</i>,
which has in many cases entirely perished except a few minute
fragments. These cases were covered with small stones, which now
seem to lie immediately upon the skeleton.</p>

<p>"Lastly, in all the Danish provinces large oak coffins are found,
formed of hollowed-out trunks of trees; these also contain human
bodies, which seem to have been buried in woollen garments.</p>

<p>"With regard to the funeral rites observed, these tombs do not
appear to have differed much. The bodies were deposited in them
with their implements, weapons, and utensils, either of bronze or
stone; but, in addition, at the bottom of the tomb, animal skins,
generally those of oxen, were often spread.</p>

<p>"Next, a new period succeeded, when the bodies were burned, and
the remains collected together. All the ancient customs were not,
however, at once given up. Thus, as the dead were formerly buried
in woollen garments, the <i>débris</i> of the bones were now wrapped in
pieces of cloaks made of the same material. Subsequently, however,
this custom also disappeared, and the ashes and remains of bones were
simply collected together in urns. This custom was observed until
the bronze epoch, and characterises, so to speak, its second and
last period&mdash;which was, however, the longest of that age.</p>

<p>"There were, then, in short, two distinct epochs in the bronze
age; firstly, that <i>in which the dead were quite simply interred</i>, either
in small sepulchral chambers or wooden coffins, and, secondly, that
<i>in which the bodies of the dead were incinerated</i>.</p>

<p>"One of the most remarkable 'finds,' as regards the first period of
the bronze epoch, was made in 1861, in the two mounds known by
the names of Treenhöi and Kengehöi, and situated near Kongeaa, in
Jutland. In each of these <i>tumuli</i> two people had been buried, both
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"> [Pg 286]</a></span>
having a double coffin, made of magnificent trunks of oak-trees. The
skeletons had been almost entirely destroyed by the damp which, on
the contrary, had preserved the garments. These individuals seem to
have been dressed almost like the Scotch; at least they must have
worn a sort of woollen petticoat, and bands by way of trousers, very
like those worn by the warriors depicted in the Carlovingian miniatures,
and, in addition, a cloak, a cap, and also perhaps a shawl.
With these garments were found some bronze swords in wooden
sheaths; also some bronze knives, a comb, some boxes, cups, small
wooden coffers, a tin ball, and, lastly, in one of the coffins, a small
flint arrow-head. A fragment of the cloak was to be seen in the
Palace of the Champ de Mars (No. 596).</p>

<p>"Another 'find' made a few miles from this <i>tumulus</i>, at Höimp, in
North Schleswig, has also brought to light skeletons in oak coffins
together with bronze implements.</p>

<p>"Discoveries of no less interest have been made in Zealand. Thus,
in 1845, in a <i>tumulus</i> at Höidegaard, near Copenhagen, a tomb
belonging to the first period of the bronze epoch was found; it was
searched in the presence of some of the principal Danish archæologists.
The tomb was placed at a distance of more than 10 feet
below the summit of the <i>tumulus</i>, and was built of stones; it was
more than 6 feet in length, and its width on the eastern side was
about 2 feet, and on the western side 19 inches. The bottom was
lined with a layer of small flint stones, on which was found, in the
first place, a skin, doubtless that of an ox, and above it, besides a
piece of tissue containing remains of human bones, a bronze sword
with a wooden sheath, covered with leather, and in a perfect state of
preservation; lastly, a box containing the following articles:&mdash;1st, a
fragment of an amber bead; 2nd, a piece of reddish stone; 3rd, a
small shell, which can be none other than the <i>Conus mediterraneus</i>;
it is perforated so as to be worn as a pendant for the neck; 4th, a fragment
of a flint point, doubtless an amulet; 5th, the tail of a serpent
(<i>Coluber lævis</i>); 6th, a small cube of pine or fir-wood, and 7th, a
bronze knife with a convex blade and ornamented handle.</p>

<p>"According to the investigations of various savants, these bones
belong to a man, who, to judge from the objects placed by his side in
his tomb, must have been some distinguished personage, and perhaps
combined the functions of a warrior and a sorcerer. The cube of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"> [Pg 287]</a></span>
pine-wood leads us to conjecture that that tree had not then completely
disappeared, and from this fact we may infer that the period
at which the sorcerer in question lived was very remote. It is,
however, possible that this piece of pine-wood, as well as the shell,
were introduced from some other country. The existence of the
<i>Conus mediterraneus</i> seems to establish the fact that Denmark had
already formed some kind of connection with the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>"<i>The second period of the bronze epoch</i> is characterised by the
custom of the cremation of the dead, which generally took place in
the following way: the body of the defunct was usually placed,
together with his weapons and ornaments, on the funeral pile, which
was built on the exact spot which was destined to form the centre of
the <i>tumulus</i>; the fire was then lighted, and, after the body was
consumed, the remains of the bones were collected together in an urn.
The rubbish that resulted was left on the spot, surrounded with
stones, and covered with earth till the <i>tumulus</i> was complete. The
urn which contained the ashes was then placed in another part of the
<i>tumulus</i>. This course of procedure was not the only one employed;
in some cases the weapons and other articles of adornment were not
placed upon the funeral-pile, but were afterwards brought and placed
round the urn.</p>

<p>"The number of tombs of the bronze epoch which have been discovered
in Denmark is very considerable. There are thousands of
<i>tumuli</i>, and many of them contain a large number of funeral urns.
A great many of these <i>tumuli</i> have been searched at various times
and have produced a number of different bronze articles. The
Museum of Copenhagen possesses no less than 600 swords dating back
to the bronze epoch."<a name="fnanchor_38"
id="fnanchor_38"></a><a href="#footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Twenty years ago, however, a very curious discovery was made at
Lübeck (Pomerania), for it exhibited, so to speak, in the same tomb,
the three modes of interment belonging to the pre-historic epochs of
the stone, bronze, and iron ages.</p>

<p>At Waldhausen, near Lübeck, a <i>tumulus</i> was found, which was
13 feet 9 inches in height. This <i>tumulus</i> was pulled down in horizontal
layers, and the following details were successively brought to
light.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"> [Pg 288]</a></span></p>
<p>At the top was a very ancient burial-place, evidently belonging to
the iron age; for the skeleton it contained was accompanied by an
object made of rusty iron and several earthenware articles. It was
buried in loose earth.</p>

<p>Underneath this, and half way down the <i>tumulus</i>, there were some
small enclosures composed of uncemented walls, each one containing a
sepulchral urn filled with calcined bones, as well as necklaces, hair-pins,
and a bronze knife.</p>

<p>Lastly, at the base of the <i>tumulus</i>, there was a tomb belonging to
the Stone Age. It was formed of large rough blocks of stone, and
contained, in addition to the bones, some coarse specimens of pottery,
with flint hatchets.</p>

<p>It is evident that the first inhabitants of the country began by
building a tomb on the bare ground, according to the customs of the
age, and then covered it up with earth. During the bronze epoch
another burial-place was made on this foundation, and a fresh heap of
earth doubled the height of the mound. Lastly, during the iron age,
a dead body was buried in a grave hollowed out on the top of the same
mound. Here, then, we have a clear delineation of the three different
modes of interment belonging to the three pre-historic periods.</p>

<p>In short, during the bronze epoch, the dead were generally buried
in sepulchral chambers, and sometimes, exceptionally, they were
burned. The custom of funeral feasts still remained in full force.
The pious practice of placing by the side of the dead body the instruments
or weapons which the individual had been fond of during his
lifetime, was likewise still kept up; and it is, moreover, owing to this
circumstance that archæological science is now enabled to collect
numerous vestiges of the ancient customs of these remote ages.</p>

<p>But we must call attention to the fact that, at the end of and after this
epoch, the hatchets and instruments which were placed in the tombs
were often of much smaller dimensions than those employed for every-day
use. They were small and delicately-made hatchets, intended as
<i>votive</i> offerings. Some might, perhaps, conclude from this that the
heirs, animated by a feeling of economy, had contented themselves
with depositing very diminutive offerings in the tombs of the dead.
The human race was already becoming degenerate, since it curtailed
its homage and its offerings to the dead!</p>

<p>In order to bring to a conclusion all the details which concern the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"> [Pg 289]</a></span>
bronze epoch, the question will naturally arise, what was the human
type at this epoch, and did it differ from that of the preceding age?
Unfortunately, the positive information which is required for the elucidation
of this question is entirely wanting; this deficiency is owing
to the extreme rarity of human bones, both in the lacustrine settlements
of Switzerland, and also in the tombs belonging to that epoch
which have been searched in different European countries. The whole
of the lacustrine settlements of Switzerland have furnished no more
than some seven skeletons, one of which was found at Meilen, two at
Nidau, one at Sutz, one in the settlement of Bienne, and two at
Auvernier. The first, that is the skeleton found at Meilen, near lake
Zurich, is the only one which belongs to the Stone Age; the six
others are all of the Bronze or Iron Ages.</p>

<p>The skeleton found at Meilen is that of a child; the skull, which
is in a tolerable state of preservation, although incomplete, occupies,
according to the observations of MM. His and Rütimeyer, a middle
place between the long and short heads.</p>

<p>Figs. 229 and 230, representing this skull, are taken from M.
Desor's work, entitled 'Mémoire sur les Palafittes.' From the mere
fact that it is a child's skull, it is almost impossible to make any use
of it in ascertaining the characteristic features of the race to which it
belongs; for these features are not sufficiently marked at such an early
age. The skull is of a very elongated shape, that is to say, it belongs
to the <i>dolichocephalous</i> type. The upper part of the skull is flattened,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"> [Pg 290]</a></span>
and it has an enormous occipital development; but, on the other hand,
there is scarcely any forehead. If these special features might be
generally applied, they would not prove much in favour of the intellectual
capacity of the Helvetic nation, or of its superiority over the
races of anterior ages; it represents, in fact, a very low type of conformation,
which, however, harmonises perfectly with the rough
manners and cruel practices of the Gallic tribes.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 230.&mdash;Skull found at Meilen, profile view.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">At the time of the discovery, this skull was accompanied by various
bones belonging to the body and limbs, which show by their extraordinary
bulk that their owners were men of very large size. We
have already remarked upon the large size of the men existing in the
Stone Age, that is to say, at the time of the first appearance of mankind.
Thus, the human type had changed but little since its first
appearance on the globe.</p>

<p>The settlement of Auvernier, in the lake of Neuchâtel has, as we
have before said, contributed two skulls. One belonged to a child
about eight years of age, and the other to an adult. The child's skull
differs very slightly from the one found at Meilen. It is small, elongated,
and has a low and narrow forehead. That of the adult presents
the same characteristics, and, in addition, an extraordinary development
of the occiput, a feature which is not observable in the former,
probably, on account of the youth of the subject. These two skulls
seem, therefore, to show that the population of the lacustrine
settlements had not at all changed at the beginning of the bronze
epoch.</p>

<p>A discovery made in the neighbourhood of Sion has confirmed
these first ideas. At this spot, in tombs of rough stone, there were
found some bodies bent into a contracted position, and accompanied by
certain bronze objects. According to MM. His and Carl Vogt, the skulls
found at Sion agree tolerably well with those discovered at Meilen
and Auvernier; and, in addition to this, the same shape is perpetuated
down to our own days in German Switzerland, where it strongly predominates,
and constitutes what is called the Helvetic type.</p>

<p>The <i>data</i> which have been collected up to the present time are not
sufficient to enable us to make any positive assertion respecting the
development of the intelligence of man during the bronze epoch. The
few skulls which have been recovered are always in an incomplete
state, and do not justify us in forming any exact opinion on this matter.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"> [Pg 291]</a></span>
But when we are considering the degree of intelligence possessed by
our ancestors at this period of man's development, there are things
which will enlighten us far better than any fragments of bones or any
remains of skeletons; these are the works which have been executed
by their hands. The fine arts had already begun to throw out promising
germs, industrial skill had become an established fact, agriculture
was in full practice, and bronze was made to adapt itself to all the
caprices and all the boldest ideas of the imagination. What more
can be necessary to prove that man, at this epoch, was already comparatively
far advanced in intellectual culture?</p>

<p>In concluding our account of the bronze epoch, the question
naturally arises whether it is possible to form any estimate of the exact
space of time embraced by this period of man's history. We shall
endeavour here to give, not the solution of the problem, but merely an
idea of the way in which scientific men have entered on the question.</p>

<p>Morlot, the Swiss archæologist and naturalist, who has written a
great deal upon the subject of the lacustrine settlements, was the first
to endeavour to estimate the duration of the Stone Age, as well as
that of the Bronze Epoch, and the following is the way in which he
set about it.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Villeneuve there is a cone or hillock
formed of gravel and <i>alluvium</i>, slowly deposited there by the stream
of the Tinière which falls at this spot into the lake of Geneva. This
cone was cut in two, to lay down the railway which runs along the side
of the lake. Its interior structure was thus laid bare, and appeared to
be perfectly regular, a proof that it had been gradually formed during
a long course of ages. There were three layers of vegetable earth
placed at different depths between the deposits of <i>alluvium</i>, each of
which double layers had in its turn formed the outer surface of the
cone.</p>

<p>The first layer was found at a depth of 3 feet 6 inches from the
top, and was 4 to 6 inches thick. In it were found some relics of the
Roman epoch.</p>

<p>The second, situated 5 feet 3 inches lower, measured 6 inches in
depth, and was recognised as belonging to the bronze age; it contained
a pair of bronze pincers and some fragments of unglazed
earthenware.</p>

<p>The lower bed lay at a depth of 18 feet from the top, and varied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"> [Pg 292]</a></span>
in thickness from 6 to 7 inches. It contained some rough earthenware,
charcoal, and animal bones, all pointing to the Stone Age, but
to the latest times of that period.</p>

<p>After having carefully examined these different beds and ascertained
the regular structure of the cone, Morlot fancied that he could
calculate approximately the age of each of them. He took for his
base of operations two historical dates; that of the entrance of the
Romans into Helvetia, fifty-eight years before Christ, and that of their
decisive expulsion towards the end of the fifth century of the Christian
era. By comparing these two dates, he came to the conclusion that
the Roman layer was at the most eighteen and at the least thirteen
centuries old. Then remarking that since that epoch the cone had
increased 3 feet 6 inches, and always going upon the hypothesis that
the increase was the same as in subsequent ages, he came to the
conclusion that the bed corresponding with the bronze epoch was at
least 2900 and at the most 4200 years old; and that the layer
belonging to the Stone Age, forming the entire remainder of the
cone, was from 4700 to 10,000 years old.</p>

<p>Another calculation, the conclusions of which agree tolerably well
with these, was made by M. Gilliéron, professor at the college of
Neuveville. We have already said that the remains of a pile-work
belonging to the Stone Age was discovered near the bridge of Thièle,
between the lakes of Bienne and Neuchâtel. It is evident that the
valley, the narrowest part of which was occupied by the lacustrine
settlement, was formerly almost entirely under water, for below this
point it suddenly widens out and retains these proportions as far as
the lake of Bienne. The lake must, therefore, have retired slowly
and regularly, as may be ascertained from an examination of the mud
deposited by it. If, therefore, we know its annual coefficient of
retreat, that is to say, how much it retired every year, we should be
able to estimate with a sufficient degree of approximation the age of
the settlement of the bridge of Thièle.</p>

<p>Now there is, not far from the lake, at about 1230 feet from the
present shore, an old abbey, that of Saint-Jean, which is known to
have been built about the year 1100. A document of that time
mentions that the cloister had the right of fishing in a certain part of
the lake; and there is some likelihood that it was built on the edge
of the lake; a supposition which naturally presents itself to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"> [Pg 293]</a></span>
mind. The lake, then, must have retired 1230 feet in 750 years.
This granted, M. Gilliéron easily calculated the time which would be
taken for a retreat of 11,072 feet, this number representing the
distance from the present shore to the entrance of the defile which
contains the settlement of the bridge of Thièle. He found by this
means that the settlement is at least 6750 years old, a figure which
confirms those of Morlot.</p>

<p>The preceding calculations assign to the Stone Age in Switzerland
an antiquity of 6000 to 7000 years before the Christian era, and to
the bronze epoch an antiquity of 4000 years before the same era.
There is still much uncertainty in the figures thus given to satisfy
public curiosity; but there is at least one fact which is altogether
unquestionable&mdash;that these calculations have dealt a fatal blow to
recognised chronology.</p>

<div class="chapsum">Essential Characteristics of the Iron Epoch&mdash;Preparation of Iron in Pre-historic
Times&mdash;Discovery of Silver and Lead&mdash;Earthenware made on the Potter's Wheel&mdash;Invention
of Coined Money.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Without</span> metals, as we have said in one of the preceding chapters,
man must have remained for ever in a state of barbarism. To this
we must add, that the civilisation of man has made progress just in
proportion to the degree of perfection he has arrived at in the working
of the metals and alloys which he has had at his disposal. The
knowledge and use of bronze communicated a strong impulse to
nascent civilisation, and was the means of founding the first human
communities. But bronze is far from possessing all the qualities
which ought to belong to metals when applied to various industrial
purposes. This alloy is neither hard nor elastic enough to make
good tools; and, in addition to this, it is composed of metals which in
a natural state are very scarce. Man requires a metal which is cheap,
hard, easy to work, and adapted to all the requirements which are
exacted by industrial skill, which is so manifold in its works and
wants.</p>

<p>A metal of this sort was at length discovered, and a new era opened
for the future of men. They learned how to extract from its ore
iron&mdash;the true king of metals, as it may well be called&mdash;on account of
its inestimable qualities. From the day when iron was first placed at
man's disposal civilisation began to make its longest strides, and as
the working of this metal improved, so the dominion of man&mdash;his
faculties and his intellectual activity&mdash;likewise enlarged in the same
proportion.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, with good reason that the name of <i>Iron Epoch</i> has
been given to the latest period of the development of primitive man,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"> [Pg 298]</a></span>
and it is not surprising that the last portion of the iron epoch formed
the commencement of historical times. After this period, in fact,
man ceased to live in that half-savage state, the most striking features
of which we have endeavoured to portray.</p>

<p>As the use of iron essentially characterises this epoch in the history
of mankind, we ought to give an account of the processes of manufacture
employed by the primitive metallurgists, that is to say, we
should inquire how they proceeded at this epoch to extract iron from
its native ore.</p>

<p>The art of metallurgy had made great progress during the bronze
epoch. There were at that time considerable workshops for the preparation
of bronze, and small foundries for melting and casting this
alloy. When once formed into weapons, instruments, and tools, bronze
objects were fashioned by artisans of various professions. The moulder's
art had already attained to a high degree of perfection, a fact which
is proved by the gigantic bronze objects which we have already mentioned,
as well as the castings, so many of which have been represented
in the preceding pages. The phenomenon of <i>tempering</i> was
well known, that is the principal modifications which are experienced
by bronze in its cooling, whether slow or sudden. It was well known
how to vary the proportions of the tin and copper so as to obtain
bronze of different degrees of hardness. All the means of soldering
were also familiarly known. Damascening was introduced in order to
diversify the appearance of wrought metallic objects. The cutting
qualities of instruments were increased by forging them and consolidating
them by hammering. They had even gone so far as to
discover the utility of the addition of certain mineral salts in the
founder's crucible in order to facilitate the fusion of the bronze.</p>

<p>Thus at the end of the bronze epoch the knowledge of metals
had attained to a comparatively considerable development. Hence
we may conclude that the substitution of iron for bronze took place
without any great difficulty. Owing to the natural progress and
successive improvements made in metallurgic art, the blacksmith
made his appearance on the scene and took the place of the bronze-moulder.</p>

<p>What, however, was the process which enabled our earliest metallurgists
to extract iron from its native ore?</p>

<p>Native iron, that is metallic iron in a natural state, is eminently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"> [Pg 299]</a></span>
rare; except in aërolites it is scarcely ever found. According to
Pallas, the Russian naturalist, certain Siberian tribes have succeeded,
with a great amount of labour, in obtaining from the aërolites which
have been met with in their country small quantities of iron, which
they have made into knives. The same practice existed among the
Laplanders. Lastly, we are told by Amerigo Vespucci that in the
fifteenth century the Indians at the mouth of the La Plata river were
in the habit of making arrow-heads and other instruments with iron
extracted from aërolites.<a name="fnanchor_39"
id="fnanchor_39"></a><a href="#footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>But, as we hardly need observe, stones of this kind do not often
drop down from the skies, and their employment is of too accidental
a character ever to have suggested to men the right mode of the
extraction of iron. It is, therefore, almost certain that the first iron
used was extracted from its ore just like copper and tin, that is, by the
reduction of its oxide under the influence of heat and charcoal. In
opposition to this explanation, some bring forward as an objection the
prodigiously high temperature which is required for the fusion of
iron, or, in fact, the almost impossibility of melting iron in the primitive
furnaces. But the fusion of iron was in no way necessary for the
extraction of this metal; and if it had been requisite to procure
liquid iron, primitive industrial skill would never have succeeded in
doing it. All that was necessary was so to reduce the oxide of iron
as to obtain the metal in a spongy state without any fusion. The
hammering of this spongy mass when in a red-hot state soon converted
it into a real bar of iron.</p>

<p>If we cast a glance on the metallurgic industry of some of the semi-barbarous
nations of ancient times, we shall find, as regards the extraction
of iron, a process in use among them which will fully justify the
idea we have formed of the way in which iron must have been obtained
in primitive times. Gmelin, the naturalist, during his travels in
Tartary, was a witness of the elementary process which was employed
by these northern tribes in procuring iron. There, every one prepares
his own iron just as every household might make its own bread. The
furnace for the extraction of iron is placed in the kitchen, and is
nothing but a mere cavity, 9 inches cube, which is filled up with iron-ore;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"> [Pg 300]</a></span>
the furnace is surmounted by an earthen chimney, and there is a
door in front of the furnace for introducing the ore, this door being
kept closed during the smelting process. In an orifice at the side the
nozzle of a pair of bellows is inserted, which are blown by one man
whilst another introduces the ore and charcoal in successive layers.
The furnace never holds more than 3&frac12; lbs. of ore for each operation.
When this quantity has been placed in the furnace, in small
pieces one after the other, all that is done is keeping up the action
of the bellows for some minutes. Lastly, the door of the furnace
is opened, and the ashes and other products of combustion having been
drawn out, a small mass of spongy iron is found, which proceeds from
the reduction of the oxide of iron by means of the charcoal, without
the metal being in a state of fusion, properly so called. This small
lump of iron was cleaned with a piece of wood, and was put on one
side to be subsequently welded to others, and hammered several times
when in a red-hot state; and by means of several forgings the whole
mass was converted into a single bar.</p>

<p>This same process for the extraction of iron from its natural oxide,
without fusion, is practised by the negroes of Fouta-Djallon, in Senegal.</p>

<p>After having become acquainted with the elementary process which
is practised by the semi-barbarous tribes of the present day, we shall
find but little difficulty in understanding all that Morlot, the Swiss
naturalist, has said as to the iron-furnaces of pre-historic man, and
shall probably agree in his opinions on the subject. Morlot, in his
'Mémoires sur l'Archéologie de la Suisse,' has described the vestiges
of the pre-historic furnaces intended for the preparation of iron, which
were found by him in Carinthia (Austria).</p>

<p>According to M. Morlot, the plan adopted for extracting iron from
its oxide in pre-historic times was as follows:&mdash;On the side of a slope
exposed to the wind, a hole was hollowed out. The bottom of this
hole was filled up with a heap of wood, on which was placed a layer of
ore. This layer of ore was covered by a second heap of wood; then,
taking advantage of a strong breeze rising, which had to perform the
functions of the bellows, the lowest pile of wood was kindled at its
base. The wood by its combustion was converted into charcoal, and
this charcoal, under the influence of heat, soon reduced the iron oxide
to a metallic state. When the combustion had come to an end, a few
pieces of iron were found among the ashes.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"> [Pg 301]</a></span></p>
<p>By increasing the size of the apparatus used, far more considerable
results were of course obtained. In Dalecarlia (Sweden), M. Morlot
found smelting-houses, so to speak, in which the original hole, of which
we have just been speaking, is surrounded with stones so as to form a
sort of circular receptacle. In this rough stone crucible layers of
charcoal and iron-ore were placed in succession. After having burnt
for some hours, the heap was searched over and the spongy iron was
found mixed with the ashes at the bottom of the furnace.</p>

<p>The slowness of the operation and the inconsiderable metallic result
induced them to increase the size of the stone receptacle. They first
gave to it a depth of 7 feet and then of 13 feet, and, at the same time,
coated the walls of it with clay. They thus had at their disposal a
kind of vast circular crucible, in which they placed successive layers of
iron-ore and wood or charcoal.</p>

<p>In this altogether elementary arrangement no use was made, as it
seems, of the bellows. This amounts to stating that the primitive method
of smelting iron was not, as is commonly thought, an adaptation of
the <i>Catalan furnace</i>. This latter process, which, even in the present
time, is made use of in the Pyrenean smelting works, does not date
back further than the times of the Roman empire. It is based on the
continual action of the bellows; whilst in the pre-historic furnaces
this instrument, we will again repeat, was never employed.</p>

<p>These primitive furnaces applied to the reduction of iron-ore, traces
of which had been recognised by Morlot, the naturalist, in Austria
and Sweden, have lately been discovered in considerable numbers in
the canton of Berne by M. Quiquerez, a scientific mining engineer.
They consist of cylindrical excavations, of no great depth, dug out on
the side of a hill and surmounted by a clay funnel of conical form.
Wood-charcoal was the fuel employed for charging the furnaces, for
stores of this combustible are always found lying round the ancient
smelting works.</p>

<p>In an extremely curious memoir, which was published in 1866 by
the Jura Society of Emulation, under the title of 'Recherches sur les
anciennes Forges du Jura Bernois,' M. Quiquerez summed up the results
of his protracted and minute investigations. A few extracts from this
valuable work will bring to our knowledge the real construction of the
furnaces used by pre-historic man; 400 of these furnaces having been
discovered by M. Quiquerez in the district of the Bernese Jura.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"> [Pg 302]</a></span></p>
<p>We will, however, previously mention that M. Quiquerez had represented,
or materialised, as it were, the results of his interesting labours,
by constructing a model in miniature of a siderurgical establishment
belonging to the earliest iron epoch. This curious specimen of workmanship
showed the clay-furnace placed against the side of a hill, the
heaps of charcoal, the scoriæ, the hut used as a dwelling by the
workmen, the furnace-implements&mdash;in short, all the details which
formed the result of the patient researches of the learned Swiss
engineer.</p>

<p>M. Quiquerez had prepared this interesting model of the ancient
industrial pursuits of man with a view of exhibiting it in the <i>Exposition
Universelle</i> of 1867, together with the very substances, productions, and
implements which he had found in his explorations in the Jura. But
the commission appointed for selecting objects for admission refused to
grant him the modest square yard of area which he required for
placing his model. How ridiculous it seems! In the immense Champ
de Mars in which so many useless and absurd objects perfectly swarmed,
one square yard of space was refused for one of the most curious
productions which was ever turned out by the skilful hands of any
<i>savant</i>!</p>

<p>The result of this unintelligent refusal was that M. Quiquerez'
model did not make its appearance in the <i>Exposition Universelle</i> in
the Champ de Mars, and that it was missing from the curious Gallery
of the History of Labour, which called forth so much of the attention
of the public. For our readers, however, it will not be altogether
lost. M. Quiquerez has been good enough to forward to us from
Bellerive, where he resides (near Délémont, canton of Basle, Switzerland)
a photograph of his curious model of a pre-historic workshop
for the preparation of iron. From this photograph we have designed
the annexed plate, representing a <i>primitive furnace for the extraction
of iron</i>.</p>

<p class="topspace2">This composition reproduces with tolerable accuracy the model in
relief constructed by the author. The furnace is shown; it is nothing
but a simple cavity surmounted by a conical chimney-funnel, and
placed against the side of a hill. Steps made of rough stone, placed on
each side of the mound, enable the workmen to mount to the summit.
The height of the funnel is about 9 feet. At the side of the furnace
stands the hut for the labourers, constructed of a number of round
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"> [Pg 303]</a></span>
poles placed side by side; for centuries past huts of this kind have
been erected in almost every country.</p>

<p>On the right, in the foreground, we may notice a heap of charcoal
intended to be placed in the furnace in order to reduce the ore; on
the left, there is the store of ore called in the ironworks the <i>ore-pen</i>.
The provision of iron-ore is enclosed between four wooden slabs,
forming a quadrangular space. In the centre are the scoriæ which
result from the operations carried on. A workman is extracting the
cake of spongy iron from the ashes of the furnace; another is hammering
on the anvil a piece of iron drawn from the furnace in order
to forge it into a bar. Round the furnace various implements are
scattered about, such as the anvil, the pincers, the hammer, &amp;c. All
the instruments are designed from various specimens found by the
author.</p>

<p>After these explanations, we may now give some extracts from
M. Quiquerez' work, and we trust our readers will find no difficulty
in comprehending the details given by the learned engineer, describing
the primitive furnaces for the extraction of iron which he discovered
in the Bernese Jura.</p>

<p>M. Quiquerez has remarked two kinds of primitive furnaces for the
fabrication of iron, or, rather, two stages of improvement in their construction.
The first sort, that which the author considers as dating
back to the most remote antiquity, is not so numerous as the others;
the second kind form the largest number of those which he has explored.</p>

<p>"Furnaces of the first kind," says M. Quiquerez, "consisted of
nothing but a small cylindrical excavation of no great regularity in
shape, with a cup-shaped bottom, hollowed out in the side of a hill
so as to give more natural height on one side; the front of the furnace
was closed up by fire-proof clay, supported with stones. This cavity
was plastered over with 4 to 6 inches of clay, generally of a whitish
colour, which became red after coming in contact with the fire.
These smelting-furnaces were not more than 12 to 18 inches in
depth, as seemed to be shown by the upper edges being rounded and
more or less scoriated. The front, which was always more or less
broken, had an opening at its base to admit a current of air, and to
allow the workmen to deal with the melted material; but this opening
seems to show that the piece of metal which had been formed during
the operation must have been extracted by breaking in the front.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"> [Pg 304]</a></span></p>
<p>"The second kind of furnace, which is by far the most numerously
found and widely distributed, is, in fact, nothing but an improvement
of that which preceded it, the edges of the furnace or crucible being
considerably raised in height. They vary in depth from 7&frac12; to 8 feet,
with a diameter of most irregular dimensions, from 18 inches
upwards, and a thickness of 12 inches to 7 feet. They are likewise
formed of fire-proof clay, and their average capacity is about 25
gallons.</p>

<p>"The constructor, having dug out in the side of the hill an opening
circular, or rather semi-circular, at the base, with a diameter nearly
three times as wide as the future furnace, arranged in the centre of
this hole a kind of furnace-bed made of plastic clay at bottom, and
covered with a layer of fire-proof clay on the top of it. The bed of
the furnace, which lies on the natural and hardly levelled earth, is,
generally speaking, not so thick as the side walls, which are formed of
sandy or siliceous clay, always fire-proof on the inside, but sometimes
of a more plastic nature on the exterior; the empty space left between
the walls of the furnace and the solid ground round it was filled up
with earth and other material. In front the furnace was enclosed by
a rough wall, sometimes straight and sometimes curving, built, without
mortar, of rough limestone, and dressed with earth to fill up the gaps.
In front of the furnace an opening was made in this wall, taking its
rise a few inches above the bottom of the furnace, and increasing in
size in an outward direction, so as to enable the workmen to see into,
and work in, the furnace.</p>

<p>"The work thus commenced was carried up to the requisite height;
and when the excavation in the side of the hill was not lofty enough,
the dome of the furnace was raised by placing buttresses against the
fire-clay, so as to prevent the earth falling in. When these furnaces
were established on almost level ground, as is sometimes the case, they
form a truncated cone, with a base varying in size according to the
height of the apparatus.</p>

<p>"The furnace was not always built upright; it often deviated from
the perpendicular, leaning to one side or the other to an extent as
considerable as its own diameter, but no constant rule as to this can
be recognised. The internal shape was just as irregular, changing
from circular to oval, without any apparent motive beyond want of
care in the workman. The crucibles or furnaces are sometimes larger
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"> [Pg 305]</a></span>
at the top than at the bottom, and sometimes these proportions are
reversed, but always with extreme irregularity. We have noticed
some which at a point 10 or 12 inches above the crucible were perceptibly
contracted on three sides, thus representing the first rudiments
of the appearance of our modern furnaces. But this, perhaps,
was nothing but a caprice on the part of the builder.</p>

<p>"The furnace thus being established, the wood was withdrawn
which had formed the cone, if, indeed, any had been used, and at the
hole made at the base of the crucible a clod of fire-clay some inches in
height was placed, so as to form a dam, and to confine in the crucible
the molten or soft metal; the scoriæ, being of a lighter nature and
floating at the top, made their escape over the top of the dam. As
the latter were not very liquid, their issue was promoted by means of
pokers or wooden poles, perhaps damped, with which also the metal was
stirred in the crucible.</p>

<p>"In neither of these two kinds of furnaces do we find any trace of
bellows, and a more or less strong draught must have been procured
through the opening made for the escape of the scoriæ, according to
the elevation of the dome of the furnace. The limestones which have
been found in certain furnaces were probably employed with a view
of increasing the draught; they doubtless belonged to the upper
part of the furnace, where they had been fixed so as to add height to
the orifice. This rudimentary plan must have been likewise used in
the earliest crucibles. The mode of obtaining a draught which we
have just pointed out is indicated most plainly by the scorification of
the walls of the furnace on the side opposite to the air-passage; this
side has evidently experienced a more intense heat, whilst on the
other the walls are much less affected by the fire, and in some cases
pieces of the mineral still remain in a pasty or semi-molten state, just
as they were when the work of the furnace ceased....</p>

<p>"The absence of any machine in the shape of bellows in the ancient
metal works of the Jura appears all the more remarkable as these
implements were known both to the Greeks and Romans; hence we
may at least infer, not only that these nations did not introduce the
art of iron-working into the Jura, but that it must have existed at a
much earlier period. It must also be remarked that the openings in
the furnaces are not placed in the direction of the winds prevailing in
the country&mdash;a plan which might have increased the draught&mdash;but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"> [Pg 306]</a></span>
are made quite at hazard, just as the nature of the spot rendered the
construction of the furnace more easy.</p>

<p>" ... In respect to fuel it must be remarked that in all the
siderurgical establishments which we have discovered, certain features
indicate that wood carbonised in a stack was exclusively used as fuel.
The furnaces are too small for the employment of rough wood; added
to this, charcoal stores are placed near the furnaces; and charcoal
burnt in a stack is constantly met with all round the sites, in the
scoriæ, and all the <i>débris</i>. We must, besides, mention the discovery,
at Bellelay, of a charcoal store 8 feet in diameter, situated under a
compact bed of peat 20 feet in thickness. It was established on
the solid earth, anterior to the formation of the peat. Now from this
very peat a parcel of coins belonging to the fifteenth century was
recovered, over which only 2 feet of peat had grown in a period of
400 years. There, too, at a depth of 9 feet, were found the scattered
bones of a horse, with the foot still shod with those undulating edged
shoes with elongated and strongly punched holes, in which were fitted
the ends of nails of the shape of a T, the heads of which were conical.
This kind of shoe is found in the Celtic settlements, the villages,
habitations, and ironworks, also in the pasturages and forests of the
country, but rarely in the Roman camps; in the latter they are
always in less number than the wider metallic shoes, which are larger,
and furnished with a groove indicating the line in which the nail-holes
were punched. The calculations which have been made from
the discovery of the coins of the fifteenth century (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1478) would
give an antiquity of at least twenty to twenty-four centuries to the
horse-shoe we have just mentioned, for the animal must have died
and been devoured on the then existing surface of the ground, and
could not have been buried in the peat, as the bones, instead of lying
grouped together, were dispersed in every direction. These same
calculations would carry back the date of the charcoal-store to an era
4000 years ago.</p>

<p>"Owing to the imperfection of the furnaces, the quantity of charcoal
used must have been quadruple the present consumption for the same
results. The metal, as it was extracted from the ore, fell down into
the bottom of the crucible. In proportion as the mass of metal increased,
a workman, with a poker made of damp green wood, brought
out the scoriæ which floated on the top, and stirred the metal so as to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"> [Pg 307]</a></span>
fine it. It is proved that these wooden pokers or poles were made use
of in all the furnace-works. A quantity of morsels of scoriæ is found
which, having been in a soft state when extracted, have retained the
imprint of the piece of wood, the end of which was evidently charred.
M. Morlot, in his article on the Roman ironworks at Wocheim, in
Upper Carniola, has also noticed the existence, in the scoriæ, of frequent
traces of pokers, sometimes round and sometimes three-cornered
in shape, but all of them must have been made of iron, whilst throughout
the whole of the Jura we have never recognised the traces of any
but wooden implements of this kind.</p>

<p>"Owing to the imperfection of the furnaces, and especially, the deficiency
in the draught caused by the want of bellows, the metal contained
in the ore could be but very imperfectly extracted; the scoriæ
are therefore still so very rich in iron that, about twenty years ago,
the manager of the ironworks at Untervelier tried to use them over
again as ore. Accumulations of this dross, measuring from 100 to
200 yards square, may be seen near certain furnaces-a fact which
would infer a somewhat considerable production of iron. The examination
of these scoriæ proves that iron was then made by one single
operation, and not liquid pigs fit for casting, or to be converted into
iron by a second series of operations.</p>

<p>"The iron produced was introduced into commerce in large blocks,
shaped like two quadrangular pyramids joined at the base, weighing
from 12 to 16 lbs. One of these pieces was found near a furnace
which had been demolished in order to establish a charcoal furnace,
in the commune of Untervelier, and another in one of the furnaces
of Boécourt.</p>

<p>"All round the furnaces there have been found numerous remains
of rough pottery; it is badly baked, and made without the help of the
wheel, from clay which is mingled with grains of quartz&mdash;the pottery,
in fact, which is called Celtic. Pieces of stag's horn have also been
discovered, which must have been used for the handles of tools; also
iron hatchets. One of them has a socket at the end made in a line
with the length of the implement; it is an instrument belonging to
the most remote period of the iron age. The others have transversal
sockets like our present hatchets. One of the latter was made of steel
so hard that it could not be touched with the file. With regard to
coins, both Gallic and Roman were found, and some of the latter were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"> [Pg 308]</a></span>
of as late a date as that of the Constantines. The persistence in
practising the routine of all the most ancient processes may be explained
by the monopoly of the iron-working trade being retained in
the same families. We have the less need to be surprised at this,
because we may notice that the wood-cutters and charcoal-burners of
our own days, when they have to take up their abode in a locality for
any length of time, and to carry on their trade there, always make
certain arrangements which have doubtless been handed down from
the most primitive times. In order to protect their beds from the
damp, they make a kind of shelf of fir-poles which is used as a bedstead.
Some of them have two stories; the under-one intended for
the children, and the one above for the parents. Moss, ferns, and
dried grass form the mattress. Coverlets impossible to describe were
made good use of, and some were even made of branches of fir-trees.
These bedsteads take the place both of benches and chairs. A stone
fire-place, roughly arranged in the centre of the hut, fills the double
function of warming in winter and cooking the food all the year round.
We may also add, that the fire, which is almost always kept lighted,
and the ashes spread over the floor all round, preserve the hut from
certain troublesome insects, which lose their lives by jumping imprudently
into this unknown trap. The smoke finds no other issue but
through a hole made in the roof."<a name="fnanchor_40"
id="fnanchor_40"></a><a href="#footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Such is the description given by M. Quiquerez of the iron furnaces
of a really pre-historic character, those, namely, which are characterised
by the absence of bellows. We think, however, that there
must have been holes below the hearth which afforded access to
currents of air, and, by being alternately open or closed, served either
to increase or diminish the intensity of the draught. But bellows,
properly so called, intended to promote the combustion and chemical
reaction between the oxide of iron and the charcoal did not then exist.</p>

<p>The addition of the bellows to iron-furnaces brought an essential
improvement to the art of the manufacture of iron.</p>

<p>Another improvement consisted in making, at the bottom of the
stone receptacle where the fuel and the ore were burnt together, a
door composed of several bricks which could be readily moved. At
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"> [Pg 309]</a></span>
the completion of each operation they drew out, through this door,
the cake of iron, which could not be so conveniently extracted at the
upper part of the furnace, on account of its height. The hammering,
assisted by several heatings, finally cleared the iron, in the usual way,
from all extraneous matter, consolidated it, and converted it into the
state of bar-iron fit for the blacksmith's use, and for the fabrication of
utensils and tools.</p>

<p>These improved primitive furnaces are well-known to German
miners under the name of <i>Stucköfen</i> ("fragment-furnaces"). They
are modified in different ways in different countries; and according to
the arrangement of the furnace, and especially according to the nature
of the ferruginous ores, certain methods or manipulations of the iron
have been introduced, which are nowadays known under the names
of the Swedish, German, Styrian, Carinthian, Corsican, and Catalan
methods.</p>

<p>The ancient furnaces for the extraction of iron may be combined
under the name of <i>smelting-forges</i> or <i>bloomeries</i>.</p>

<p>The invention of siliceous fluxes as applied to the extraction of iron,
and facilitating the production of a liquid scoria which could flow out
in the form of a stream of fire, put the finishing stroke to the preparation
of iron. The constructors next considerably increased the
height of the stone crucible in which the fuel and the ore, now
mingled with a siliceous flux, were placed, and the <i>blast furnace</i>, that
is, the present system of the preparation of iron, soon came into
existence.</p>

<p>But, there may be reason to think, neither of these two kinds of
furnaces belongs to the primitive ages of mankind which are the
object of this work. In the iron epoch&mdash;that we are considering&mdash;the
furnace without bellows was possibly the only one known; the iron
was prepared in very small quantities at a time, and the meagre
metallic cake, the result from each operation, had to be picked out
from among the ashes drawn from the stone receptacle.</p>

<p>Gold, as we have already said, was known to the men of the bronze
epoch. Silver, on the contrary, did not come into use until the iron
epoch.</p>

<p>Another characteristic of the epoch we are now studying is the
appearance of pottery made on the potter's wheel, and baked in an
improved kind of furnace. Up to that time, pottery had been moulded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"> [Pg 310]</a></span>
by the hand, and merely burnt in the open air. In the iron epoch,
the potter's wheel came into use, and articles of earthenware were
manufactured on this wheel, and baked in an unexceptionable way in
an oven especially constructed for the purpose.</p>

<p>There is another fact which likewise characterises the iron epoch;
this was the appearance of coined money. The earliest known coins
belong to this period; they are made of bronze, and bear a figure or
effigy not stamped, but obtained by melting and casting.</p>

<p>The most ancient coins that are known are Greek, and date back
to the eighth century before Christ. These are the coins of Ægina,
Athens, and Cyzicum, such as were found many years ago in the duchy
of Posen. In the lacustrine settlement of Neuchâtel, coins of a
remote antiquity have also been found. We here represent in its
natural size (fig. 232), taken from M. Desor's work, a bronze coin
found in the settlement of La Tène in the lake of Neuchâtel. But
these coins are not more ancient than the Greek specimens that we
have before named. They are shown to be Gallic by the horned horse,
which is a Gallic emblem.</p>

<p class="topspace2">At Tiefenau, near Berne, coins have been found of a nearly similar
character associated with others having on them the effigy of Apollo,
and bearing an imprint of <i>Massilia</i> (Marseilles). As the foundation
of this Phocæan colony dates back to the sixth century before Christ,
these coins may be said to be among the most ancient which exist.</p>

<p>Glass became known, as we have before stated, in the bronze
epoch.</p>

<p>In short, the essential features which distinguish the iron epoch
are, iron instruments, and implements combining with those of bronze
to replace stone in all the uses for which it was anciently employed&mdash;the
knowledge of silver and lead, the improvement of pottery, and the
introduction of coined money. With regard to its chronological date
we should adopt that of about 2000 years before the Christian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"> [Pg 311]</a></span>
era, thus agreeing with the generality of authors&mdash;the date of the
bronze epoch being fixed about 4000 years before Christ.</p>

<p>After these general considerations, we shall pass on to give some
account of the manners and customs of man during the iron epoch,
or, at least, during the earlier portion of this period, which ere long
became blended with historic ages.</p>

<p>When we have completed our study of man in the earlier period of
the iron epoch, we shall have terminated the rapid sketch which we
have intended to trace out of primitive man and his labours. This
period commenced, as we have just stated, about 2000 years before
Christ, and ultimately merged into the earliest glimmer of historical
records. Our task now is to describe all we know about man at this
date of nascent civilisation. Afterwards, the earliest historians&mdash;and
among them, Herodotus, the father of history&mdash;are the authorities
whom we must consult for an account of the actions and exploits of
the human race in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> most valuable traces of the manners and customs of man
during the earlier period of the iron epoch have been furnished by
the vast burial-ground discovered recently at Hallstadt, near Salzburg
in Austria. M. Ramsauer, Director of the salt-mines of Salzburg,
has explored more than 1000 tombs in this locality, and has
described them in a work full of interest, a manuscript copy of which
we have consulted in the Archæological Museum of Saint-Germain.</p>

<p>As the tombs at Hallstadt belong to the earlier period of the iron
epoch, they represent to us the natural transition from the epoch of
bronze to that of iron. In fact, in a great number of objects contained
in these tombs&mdash;such as daggers, swords and various ornaments&mdash;bronze
and iron are combined. One sword, for instance, is
formed of a bronze hilt and an iron blade. This is represented in
figures 233, 234, 235 and 236, drawn from the sketches in M.
Ramsauer's manuscript work entitled 'Les Tombes de Hallstadt,' in
which this combination of the two metals is remarked upon; the
sword-hilts being formed of one metal and the blades of another.</p>

</div>

<p class="topspace2">By taking a rapid survey of the objects found in the tombs of
Hallstadt, we can form a somewhat accurate idea of the first outset of
the iron age.</p>

<p>The first point which strikes us in this period, is the utter change
which had taken place in the interment of the dead.</p>

<p>During the Stone Age, the dead were placed in small subterranean
crypts, that is in <i>dolmens</i> or <i>tumuli</i>. During the Bronze Age it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"> [Pg 313]</a></span>
became to a great extent customary for men to burn the dead bodies
of their friends.</p>

<p>This custom was destined to become more and more prevalent
century after century, and during historic times it became universal
among a great many nations.</p>

<p>In fact, in the tombs of Hallstadt, several little earthen vessels
containing ashes may be seen. Sometimes only part of the body was
burnt, so that a portion of a skeleton was found in these tombs, and
near it the ashes of the parts which the fire had consumed.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"> [Pg 314]</a></span></p>
<p>The remains found in the tombs of Hallstadt are almost equally
divided between these two modes of inhumation. About half of
the tombs contain nothing but ashes; in the other half, corpses are
laid extended, according to the custom which was most prevalent in
the iron age. Lastly, as we have just stated, some of them contained
skeletons which were partially burnt. Sometimes it was the head,
sometimes the whole bust, or sometimes the lower limbs which were
consumed, the ashes being deposited by the side of the intact portions
of the skeleton. Fig. 238, which is designed from one of the illustrations
in M. Ramsauer's manuscript work 'Les Tombes de Hallstadt,'
in the Museum of Saint-Germain, represents a skeleton, part of which
(the chest) has been consumed. The ashes are contained in small
earthen vessels which are seen near the corpse.</p>

<p class="topspace2">From the <i>data</i> which we have acquired as to this custom of burning
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"> [Pg 315]</a></span>
dead bodies during the iron epoch, we have been able to represent <i>the
funeral ceremonies of the iron epoch</i> in the preceding figure.</p>

<p>The corpse is placed on a funeral pile, and the stone door of the
tumulus is raised in order to deposit in it the cinerary urn. The
relations of the deceased accompany the procession clothed in their
handsomest garments and adorned with the bronze and iron ornaments
which were then in vogue. One of those present may be
seen throwing some precious objects into the flames of the funeral pile
in honour of the deceased.</p>

<p>The tombs of Hallstadt are the locality in which the largest number
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"> [Pg 316]</a></span>
of objects, such as weapons, instruments and implements, have been
met with, which have tended to throw a light upon the history of the
transition from the bronze to the iron epoch. All these objects are
either of bronze or iron; but in the weapons the latter predominates.
Swords, spear-heads, daggers, knives, socketed hatchets and winged
hatchets form the catalogue of the sharp instruments. In the preceding
pages (figs. 233, 234, 235 and 236) we have given representations
of swords and daggers designed from the specimens in the Museum
of Saint-Germain. In all these weapons the handle is made of bronze
and the blade of iron. Warriors' sword-belts are frequently formed of
plates of bronze, and are embellished with a <i>repoussé</i> ornamentation
executed by the hammer.</p>

<p>In fig. 239 we give a representation of a necklace with pendants
which is most remarkable in its workmanship. It may be readily
seen that art had now attained some degree of maturity. This necklace
was a prelude to the marvellous works of art which were about
to be brought to light under the skies of Greece.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"> [Pg 317]</a></span>
and bronze fibulæ are all wrought with taste, and are often adorned
with very elegant pendants. In figs. 240 and 241 we show two
bracelets, the sketches for which were taken from the designs in the
manuscript of the 'Tombes de Hallstadt.'</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">We may add a few amber necklace-beads and some of enamel, and
we have then concluded the series of personal ornaments.</p>

<p>In the tombs of Hallstadt, nearly 200 bronze vessels have been
discovered, some of which are as much as 36 inches in height. These
bronze vessels were composed of several pieces skilfully riveted but
not soldered. Plates 242 and 243 are reproduced from the same
beautiful manuscript.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 243.&mdash;Bronze Vase, from the Tombs of Hallstadt.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">In the tombs of Hallstadt some small glass vessels have also been
discovered.</p>

<p>Remains of pottery are very plentiful, and a decided improvement is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"> [Pg 318]</a></span>
shown in their workmanship. Some gold trinkets were also met with
in these tombs. The gold was, doubtless, obtained from the mines of
Transylvania.</p>

<p>African ivory abounds in these graves&mdash;a fact which indicates commercial
intercourse with very distant countries. This product, as well
as the glass, was introduced into Europe by the Ph&#339;nicians. The
inhabitants of central Europe obtained ivory from Tyre and Sidon by
means of barter.</p>

<p>The ivory objects which were found at Hallstadt consisted of the
heads of hair-pins and the pommels of swords.</p>

<p>There were no traces whatever of money, the use of it not being
then established in that part of Europe.</p>

<p>The population which lived in the vicinity of the Salzburg mines
were in reality rich; for the salt-mines were a source of great wealth
to them at a period when the deposits of rock-salt in Poland, being
still buried in the depths of the earth, were as yet unknown or
inaccessible. In this way, we may account for the general opulence
of these commercial nations, and for the elegance and taste displayed
in the objects which have been found in the tombs of Hallstadt.</p>

<p>Guided by these various remains, it is not difficult to reproduce an
ideal picture of <i>the warriors of the iron epoch</i>, a representation of
which we have endeavoured to give in fig. 244. The different pieces
of the ornaments observed on the horseman, on the foot-soldier, and
also on the horse, are drawn from specimens exhibited in the Museum
of Saint-Germain which were modelled at Hallstadt. The helmet is in
perfect preservation and resembles those which, shortly after, were
worn by the Gallic soldiers. The bosses, also, on the horse's harness,
ere long came into use both among the Gauls and also the Romans.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">Next to the tombs of Hallstadt, we must mention the tombs discovered
on the plateau of La Somma, in Lombardy, which have
contributed a valuable addition to the history of the earliest period of
the iron epoch.</p>

<p>On this plateau there were discovered certain tombs, composed of
rough stones of a rectangular form. In the interior there were some
vases of a shape suited to the purpose, containing ashes. The material
of which they were made was fine clay; they had been wrought by
means of the potter's wheel, were ornamented with various designs,
and also provided with encircling projections. On some of them,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"> [Pg 319]</a></span>
representations of animals may be seen which indicate a considerable
progress in the province of art. The historic date of these urns is
pointed out by <i>fibulæ</i> (clasps for cloaks), iron rings and bracelets,
sword-belts partly bronze and partly iron, and small bronze chains.
The tombs of La Somma belong, therefore, to a period of transition
between the bronze and iron epochs. According to M. Mortillet, they
date back to the seventh century before Christ.</p>

<p>Under the same head we will class the tombs of Saint-Jean de
Belleville, in Savoy. At this spot several tombs belonging to the
commencement of the iron epoch have been explored by MM. Borel
and Costa de Beauregard. The latter, in a splendid work published in
Savoy, has given a detailed description of these tombs.<a name="fnanchor_41"
id="fnanchor_41"></a><a href="#footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Some of the skeletons are extended on their backs, others have been
consumed, but only partially, like those which we have already mentioned
in the tombs of Hallstadt. Various objects, consisting chiefly
of trinkets and ornaments, have been met with in these tombs. We
will mention in particular the <i>fibulæ</i>, bracelets and necklaces made of
amber, enamelled glass, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In figs. 245 and 246 we give a representation of two skeleton arms,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"> [Pg 320]</a></span>
which are encircled with several bracelets just as they were found in
these tombs.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">The lacustrine settlements of Switzerland have contributed a valuable
element towards the historic reconstruction of the iron epoch.</p>

<p>In different parts of the lakes of Bienne and Neuchâtel there are
pile-works which contain iron objects intermingled with the remains
of preceding ages. But there is only one lacustrine settlement in
Switzerland which belongs exclusively to the earliest period of the
Iron Age&mdash;that of La Tène on the Lake of Neuchâtel.</p>

<p>Most of the objects which have been met with in this lacustrine
settlement have been recovered from the mud in which they had been
so remarkably preserved, being sheltered from any contact with the
outer air. There are, however, many spots in which piles may be
seen, where objects of this kind have not been found; but if subsequent
researches are attended with any results, we shall be forced to
attribute to the settlement of La Tène a considerable degree of importance,
for the piles there extend over an area of 37 acres.</p>

<p>The remains of all kinds which have been found in this settlement
are evidently of Gallic origin. It is an easy matter to prove this by
comparing the weapons found in this settlement with those which
were discovered in the trenches of Alise-Sainte-Reine, the ancient
<i>Alesia</i>, where, in its last contest against Cæsar, the independence of
ancient Gaul came to an end.</p>

<p>M. de Rougemont has called attention to the fact that these weapons
correspond very exactly to the description given by Diodorus Siculus
of the Gallic weapons. Switzerland thus seems to have been inhabited
in the earliest iron epoch by Gallic tribes, that is to say, by a different
race from that which occupied it during the stone and bronze epochs;
and it was this race which introduced into Switzerland the use of iron.</p>

<p>Among the objects collected in the lake settlement of La Tène,
weapons are the most numerous; they consist of swords and the heads
of spears and javelins. Most of them have been kept from oxidation
by the peaty mud which entirely covered them, and they are, consequently,
in a state of perfect preservation.</p>

<p>The swords are all straight, of no very great thickness, and perfectly
flat. The blade is from 31 to 35 inches in length, and is terminated
by a handle about 6 inches long. They have neither guards nor crosspieces.
Several of them were still in their sheaths, from which many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"> [Pg 321]</a></span>
of them have been drawn out in a state of perfect preservation, and
even tolerably sharp.</p>

<p>Fig. 247 represents one of the iron swords from the Swiss lakes,
which are depicted in M. Desor's memoir.</p>

<div class="figcenter topspace2"><a name="i_398a.jpg" id="i_398a.jpg"></a>

<div class="caption">Fig. 247.&mdash;Iron Sword, found in one of the
Swiss Lakes.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">On another sword, of which we also give a representation (fig. 248),
a sort of damascening work extends over almost the whole surface,
leaving the edges alone entirely smooth.</p>

<div class="figcenter topspace2"><a name="i_398b.jpg" id="i_398b.jpg"></a>

<div class="caption">Fig. 248.&mdash;Sword with Damascened Blade,
found in one of the Swiss Lakes.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">M. de Reffye, the archæologist, accounts for this fact in the following
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"> [Pg 322]</a></span>
way:&mdash;He is of opinion that the body of the blade is made of very
hard unyielding iron, whilst the edges are made of small strips of
mellower iron which have been subsequently welded and wrought by
the hammer. This mode of manufacture enabled the soldier, when
his sword was notched, to repair it by means of hammering. This
was a most valuable resource during an epoch in which armies did not
convey stores along with them, and when the soldier's baggage was
reduced to very little more than he could personally carry. Several
of these damascened blades have been found in the trenches of Alise.</p>

<p>The sheaths, the existence of which now for the first time comes
under our notice, are of great importance on account of the designs
with which they are ornamented. Most of these designs are engraved
with a tool, others are executed in <i>repoussé</i> work. All of them show
great originality and peculiar characteristics, which prevent them from
being confounded with works of Roman art. One of these sheaths
(fig. 249), which belongs to M. Desor's collection and is depicted in
his memoir, represents the "horned horse," the emblem of Gaul, which
is sufficient proof of the Gallic origin of the weapons found in the Lake
of La Tène. Below this emblem, there is a kind of granulated surface
which bears some resemblance to shagreen.</p>

<div class="figcenter topspace2"><a name="i_399.jpg" id="i_399.jpg"></a>
<img src="images/i_399.jpg"
alt="Sheath of a Sword"  />
<div class="caption">Fig 249.&mdash;Sheath of a Sword, found in one of
the Swiss Lakes.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">This sheath is composed of two very thin plates of wrought iron
laid one upon the other, except at the base, where they are united by
means of a cleverly-wrought band of iron. At its upper extremity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"> [Pg 323]</a></span>
there is a plate, on one side of which may be seen the designs which
we have already described, and on the other a ring, intended to suspend
the weapon to the belt.</p>

<p>The lance-heads are very remarkable on account of their extraordinary
shape and large size. They measure as much as 16 inches
long, by 2 to 4 inches wide, and are double-edged and twisted into
very diversified shapes. Some are winged, and others are irregularly
indented. Some have perforations in the shape of a half-moon
(fig. 250). The halberd of the middle ages was, very probably,
nothing but an improvement on, or a deviation from, these singular
blades.</p>

<div class="figcenter topspace2"><a name="i_400.jpg" id="i_400.jpg"></a>

alt="Lance-head"  />
<div class="caption">Fig. 250.&mdash;Lance-head, found in one of the Swiss Lakes.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">Fragments of wooden staves have been met with which had been
fitted into these spear-heads; they are slender, and shod with iron at
one end.</p>

<p>The care with which these instruments are wrought proves that
they are lance-heads, and not mere darts or javelins intended to be
thrown to a distance and consequently lost. They certainly would
not have taken so much pains with the manufacture of a weapon
which would be used only once.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"> [Pg 324]</a></span></p>
<p>It is altogether a different matter with respect to the javelins, a
tolerably large number of which have been found in the lacustrine
settlements of La Tène. They are simple socketed heads (fig. 251),
terminating in a laurel-leaf shape, about 4 to 5 inches in length.</p>

<div class="figcenter topspace2"><a name="i_401.jpg" id="i_401.jpg"></a>

alt="Javelin head"  />
<div class="caption">Fig. 251.&mdash;Head of a Javelin, found in the
Lacustrine Settlement of La Tène (Neuchâtel).
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">It appears from experiments ordered by the Emperor of the French,
that these javelins could only have been used as missile weapons, and
that they were thrown, not by the hand merely grasping the shaft
(which would be impossible to do effectually on account of their light
weight), but by means of a cord or thong, which was designated
among the Romans by the name of <i>amentum</i>. These experiments
have shown that a dart which could be thrown only 65 feet with
the hand, might be cast four times that distance by the aid of the
<i>amentum</i>. There probably existed among the Gauls certain military
corps who practised the use of the <i>amentum</i>, that is to say, the
management of <i>thonged javelins</i>, and threw this javelin in the
same way as other warriors threw stones by means of a sling.
This conclusion, which has been drawn by M. Desor, seems to us a
very just one.</p>

<p>Javelins of the preceding type are very common in the trenches of
Alise. In this neighbourhood a large number of iron arrows have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"> [Pg 325]</a></span>
also been found which have never been met with in the lacustrine
settlement of La Tène.</p>

<p>War was not the only purpose for which these javelins were used
by the men of the iron epoch. Hunting, too, was carried on by means
of these missile weapons. The bow and the thonged javelin constituted
the hunting weapons of this epoch. We have depicted this in the
accompanying plate, which represents <i>the chase during the iron epoch</i>.</p>

<p class="topspace2">Next to the weapons come the implements. We will, in the first
place, mention the hatchets (fig. 253). They are larger, more solid,
and have a wider cutting edge than those used in the bronze epoch;
wings were no longer in use, only a square-shaped socket into which
was fitted a wooden handle, probably made with an elbow.</p>

<p class="topspace2">The sickles (fig. 254) are likewise larger and also more simple than
those of the bronze epoch; there are neither designs nor ornaments
of any kind on them.</p>

been discovered in the lake settlement of the Tène. Their length is
about 14 inches, that is, about one-third as large as the scythes used
by the Swiss harvest-men of the present day. One important inference
is drawn from the existence of these scythes; it is, that at the
commencement of the iron epoch men were in the habit of storing up
a provision of hay, and must consequently have reared cattle.</p>

a quadrangular pyramid or in a cone (fig. 256). Some still contain the

terminated at each end in a ring to which the reins were attached.</p>

<p class="topspace2">The <i>fibulæ</i> (fig. 258), or clasps for cloaks, are especially calculated
to attract attention in the class of ornamental objects; they are very
elegant and diversified in their shapes, their dimensions varying from
2&frac12; to 5 inches. They are all formed of a pin in communication with
a twisted spring bent in various ways. They are provided with a
sheath to hold the end of the brooch pin, so as to avoid any danger
of pricking. A large number of them are in an excellent state of
preservation, and might well be used at the present day.</p>

<p class="topspace2">These brooches, which we have already called attention to when
speaking of the tombs of Hallstadt, were also used by the Etruscans
and the Romans; their existence in the pre-historic tombs
tends to prove that, like the above-named nations, the Swiss and
Germans wore the toga or mantle. These <i>fibulæ</i> have a peculiar
character, and it is impossible to confuse them with the Roman <i>fibulæ</i>.
They are, however, similar in every way to those which have been
found at Alise.</p>

<p>There have also been found in the Swiss lakes, along with the
<i>fibulæ</i>, a number of rings, the use of which is still problematical.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"> [Pg 328]</a></span>
Some are flat and others chiselled in various ways. It is thought
that some of them must have been used as buckles for soldiers' sword-belts
(fig. 259); but there are others which do not afford any
countenance to this explanation. Neither can they be looked on
as bracelets; for most of them are too small for any such purpose.
Some show numerous cuts at regular intervals all round their circumference;
this fact has given rise to the supposition that they might
perhaps have served as a kind of money.</p>

<p class="topspace2">The specimens of pottery belonging to this date do not testify to
any real progress having been made beyond the workmanship of the
bronze epoch; the clay is still badly baked, and of a darkish colour.
It certainly is the case, that along with these remains a quantity of
fragments of vessels have been picked up, and even entire vessels,
which have been made by the help of the potter's wheel and baked in
an oven, and consequently present the red colour usual in modern
earthenware. But archæologists are of opinion that this class of
pottery does not date back beyond the Roman epoch; and this
opinion would seem to be confirmed by the existence, in the midst of
the piles at the settlement of La Tène, of a mass of tiles, evidently of
Roman origin. The conclusion to be drawn from these facts is, that
many of the pile-works in the Swiss lakes continued to be occupied
when the country was under the Roman rule.</p>

<p>One of the characteristics of the iron epoch is, as we have before
stated, the appearance of coin or money. In 1864, M. Desor recovered
from the Lake of La Tène five coins of unquestionable Gallic
origin. They are of bronze, and bear on one side the figure of the
horned horse, and on the other a human profile. In fig. 232, we
gave a representation of these curious specimens of coin found by
M. Desor in the lacustrine settlements of the Lake of Neuchâtel.
The marks of the mould still existing on each side show that these
coins were cast in a series, and that after the casting the coins were
separated from one another by means of the file.</p>

<p>Coins of a similar character have been discovered, as we before
observed, at Tiefenau, near Berne, with others bearing the effigy
of Diana and Apollo, and the imprint of <i>Massilia</i>, The latter date
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"> [Pg 330]</a></span>
from the foundation of Marseilles, and could not, therefore, be anterior
to the sixth century before the Christian era; it is probable that those
discovered along with them must be referred to nearly the same epoch.</p>

<p>Such are the relics of instruments, tools, weapons, &amp;c., made of iron
and recovered from the lacustrine settlement of La Tène, that is, from
the Lake of Neuchâtel. We must add that, near Berne, at a spot
which is designated by the name of the "Battle-field of Tiefenau,"
because it appears to have been the theatre of a great conflict between
the Helvetians and the Gauls, a hundred swords and spear-heads have
been picked up, similar to those found at La Tène; also fragments of
coats of mail, rings, <i>fibulæ</i>, the tires of chariot-wheels, horses' bits,
and lastly, Gallic and Marseillaise coins in gold, silver, and bronze. This
field of battle appears, therefore, to have been contemporary with the
settlement at La Tène.</p>

<p>In addition to these valuable sources of information&mdash;La Tène and
Tiefenau&mdash;Switzerland also possesses <i>tumuli</i> and simple tombs, both
constituting records useful to consult in respect to the iron epoch.
But on this point, it must be remarked that it is often difficult, with
any degree of security, to connect them with the two preceding sites;
and that considerable reserve is recommended in attempting any kind
of identification.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, the Iron Age, looking even only to its earliest
period, is the date of the beginning of real civilisation among European
nations.</p>

<p>Their industrial skill, exercised on the earliest-used materials, such
as iron and textile products, furnished all that was required by the
usages of life. Commerce was already in a flourishing state,
for it was no longer carried on by the process of barter only.
Money, in the shape of coin, the conventional symbol of wealth, came
into use during this epoch, and must have singularly facilitated the
operations of trade. Agriculture, too, had advanced as much as it
could at this earliest dawn of civilisation. The remains of cereals
found in the lake-settlements of Switzerland, added to the iron instruments
intended to secure the products of the cultivation of the ground,
such as the scythes and sickles which we have previously depicted (figs.
254 and 255), are sufficient to show us that agriculture constituted at
that time the chief wealth of nations. The horse, the ass, the dog,
the ox, and the pig, had for long time back been devoted to the service
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"> [Pg 331]</a></span>
of man, either as auxiliaries in his field-labours, or as additions to his
resources in the article of food. Fruit-trees, too, were cultivated in
great numbers.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 263.&mdash;Agriculture during the Iron Epoch.
</div>
</div>

<p class="topspace2">As a matter of fact, we have no acquaintance with any of the iron
and bronze instruments which were used by men of the iron epoch in
cultivation of the ground. Scythes and sickles are the only agricultural
implements which have been discovered. But even these
instruments, added to a quantity of remains of the bones of cattle
which have been found in the lacustrine and palustrine settlements, are
sufficient to prove that the art of cultivating the earth and of extracting
produce from its bosom, rendered fertile by practices sanctioned by
experience, existed in full vigour among the men who lived during the
period immediately preceding historic times.</p>

<p>The plate which accompanies this page is intended to represent in
a material form the state of agriculture during the iron epoch. We
may notice the corn-harvest being carried on by means of sickles, like
those found in the lacustrine settlements of Switzerland. A man is
engaged in beating out, with a mere stick, the wheatsheaves in order
to thrash out the grain. The grain is then ground in a circular mill,
worked by a horizontal handle. This mill is composed of two stones
revolving one above the other, and was the substitute for the rough
primitive corn-mill; it subsequently became the mill used by the
Romans&mdash;the <i>pistrinum</i>&mdash;at which the slaves were condemned to
work.</p>

<p>Indications of an unequivocal character have enabled us to recognise
as a fact, that human sacrifices took place among the Helvetians during
this period. It is, however, well known, from the accounts of ancient
historians, that this barbarous custom existed among the Gauls and
various nations in the north of Europe. In a <i>tumulus</i> situated near
Lausanne, which contained four cinerary urns, there were also found
the skeletons of four young females. Their broken bones testified but
too surely to the tortures which had terminated their existence. The
remains of their ornaments lay scattered about in every direction, and
everything was calculated to lead to the belief that they had been
crushed under the mass of stones which formed the <i>tumulus</i>&mdash;unhappy
victims of a cruel superstition. Not far from this spot, another
<i>tumulus</i> contained twelve skeletons lying in all kinds of unusual
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"> [Pg 332]</a></span>
postures. It is but too probable that these were the remains of
individuals who had all been immolated together on the altar of some
supposed implacable divinity.</p>

<p>What was the character of the type of the human race during the
iron epoch? It must evidently have been that of the present era.
Both the skulls and the bodies of the skeletons found in the tombs of
this epoch point to a race of men entirely identical with that of our
own days.</p>

<p>We shall not carry on our study of pre-historic mankind to any later
date. We have now arrived at an epoch upon which sufficient light
has been thrown by oral tradition combined with historical records.
The task of the historian begins at the point where the naturalist's
investigations come to an end.</p>

<h2><a name="PRIMITIVE_MAN_IN_AMERICA" id="PRIMITIVE_MAN_IN_AMERICA">PRIMITIVE MAN IN AMERICA.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> development of mankind has, doubtless, been of much the same
character in all parts of the world, so that, in whatever quarter of the
world man may come under our consideration, he must have passed
through the same phases of progress ere he arrived at his present
state. Everywhere, man must have had his Stone Age, his Bronze
Epoch, and his Iron Epoch, succeeding one another in the same order
which we have ascertained to have existed in Europe. In the sketch
which we have drawn of primitive man we have devoted our attention
almost entirely to Europe; but the cause simply is, that this part of the
world has, up to the present day, been the principal subject of special
and attentive studies in this respect. Asia, Africa, and America can
scarcely be said to have been explored in reference to the antiquity of
our species; but it is probable that the facts which have been brought
to light in Europe, would be almost identically reproduced in other
parts of the world.</p>

<p>This is a fact which, as regards <i>dolmens</i>, has been already verified.
The sepulchral monuments of the Stone Age, which were at first
believed to be peculiar to France, and, indeed, to one province of
France, namely Brittany, have since been met with in almost every
part of the world. Not only have they been discovered all over Europe,
but even the coasts of Africa bring to our notice numerous relics of
them; also, through the whole extent of Asia, and even in the interior
of India, this same form of sepulchre, bearing witness to a well
determined epoch in man's history, have been pointed out and described
by recent travellers.</p>

<p>Thus, the information which we possess on these points as regards
Europe, may well be generalised and applied to the other quarters of
the world&mdash;to Asia, Africa, America, and Oceania.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"> [Pg 336]</a></span></p>
<p>America, however, has been the scene of certain investigations concerning
primitive man which have not been without fertile results;
we shall, therefore, devote the last few pages of our work to a consideration
of the pre-historic remains of America, and to giving an
account of the probable conditions of man's existence there, as they
have been revealed to us by these relics.</p>

<p>The information which has been made public on these points concerns
North America only.</p>

<p>It would be useless to dwell on the stone and bone instruments of
the New World; in their shape they differ but little from those of
Europe. They were applied to the same uses, and the only perceptible
difference in them is in the substance of which they were
made. We find there hatchets, knives, arrow-heads, &amp;c., but these
instruments are not so almost universally made from flint, which
is to a considerable extent replaced by obsidian and other hard
stones.</p>

<p>In the history of primitive man in North America, we shall have
to invent another age of a special character; this is the <i>Age of
Copper</i>. In America, the use of copper seems to have preceded the
use of bronze; native metallic copper having been largely in use
among certain races. On the shores of Lake Superior there are
some very important mines of native copper, which must have been
worked by the Indians at a very early date; in fact, the traces
of the ancient workings have been distinctly recognised by various
travellers.</p>

<p>Mr. Knapp, the agent of the Minnesota Mining Company, was the
first to point out these pre-historic mines. In 1847, his researches
having led him into a cavern much frequented by porcupines, he
discovered, under an accumulation of heaped-up earth, a vein of
native copper, containing a great number of stone hammers. A short
time afterwards, some other excavations 25 to 35 feet in depth, and
stretching over an extent of several miles, came under his notice.
The earth dug out had been thrown on each side of the excavations;
and mighty forest-trees had taken root and grown there. In the
trunk of a hemlock-tree growing in this "made ground," Mr. Knapp
counted 395 rings of growth, and this tree had probably been preceded
by other forest-giants no less venerable. In the trenches
themselves, which had been gradually filled up by vegetable <i>débris</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"> [Pg 337]</a></span>
trees had formerly grown which, after having lived for hundreds of
years, had succumbed and decayed; being then replaced by other
generations of vegetation, the duration of which had been quite as
long. When, therefore, we consider these workings of the native
copper-mines of Lake Superior, we are compelled to ascribe the above-named
excavations to a considerable antiquity.</p>

<p>In many of these ancient diggings stone hammers have been
found, sometimes in large quantities. One of the diggings contained
some great diorite hatchets which were worked by the aid of a
handle, and also large cylindrical masses of the same substance
hollowed out to receive a handle. These sledges, which are too heavy
to be lifted by one man alone, were doubtless used for breaking off
lumps of copper, and then reducing them to fragments of a size
which could easily be carried away. If we may put faith in Professor
Mather, who explored these ancient mines, some of the rocks still
bore the mark of the blow they had received from these granite
rollers.</p>

<p>The work employed in adapting the native copper was of the most
simple character. The Indians hammered it cold, and, taking into
account its malleable character, they were enabled with tolerable
facility to give it any shape that they wished.</p>

<p>In America, just as in Europe, a great number of specimens of
pre-historic pottery have been collected. They are, it must be confessed,
superior to most of those found in the ancient world. The
material of which they were made is very fine, excepting in the case
of the vessels of every-day use, in which the clay is mixed with
quartz reduced to powder; the shapes of the vessels are of the purest
character, and the utmost care has been devoted to the workmanship.
They do not appear to have been constructed by the aid of the potter's
wheel; but Messrs. Squier and Davis, very competent American
archæologists, are of opinion that the Indians, in doing this kind of
work, made use of a stick held in the middle. The workman turned
this stick round and round inside the mass of clay, which an assistant
kept on adding to all round the circumference.</p>

<p>In regard to pottery, the most interesting specimens are the pipes,
which we should, indeed, expect to meet with in the native country
of the tobacco plant and the classic calumet. Many of these pipes
are carved in the shape of animals, which are very faithfully represented.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"> [Pg 338]</a></span>
These figures are very various in character, including quadrupeds
and birds of all kinds. Indeed, in the state of Ohio seven
pipes were found on each of which the manatee was so plainly depicted
that it is impossible to mistake the sculptor's intention. This discovery
is a curious one, from the fact that at the present day the
manatee is not met with except in localities 300 or 400 leagues
distant, as in Florida.</p>

<p>The pre-historic ornaments and trinkets found in North America
consist of bracelets, necklaces, earrings, &amp;c. The bracelets are copper
rings bent by hammering, so that the two ends meet. The necklaces
are composed of shell beads (of which considerable quantities have
been collected) shells, animals' teeth, and small flakes of mica, all
perforated by a hole so as to be strung on a thread. The earrings
also are made of the same material.</p>

<p>All these objects&mdash;weapons, implements, pottery, and ornaments&mdash;have
been derived from certain gigantic works which exhibit some
similarity, and occasionally even a striking resemblance, to the great
earthwork constructions of the Old World. American archæologists
have arranged these works in various classes according to the probable
purpose for which they were intended; we shall now dwell for a short
time on these divisions.</p>

<p>In the first place, we have the <i>sepulchral mounds</i> or <i>tumuli</i>, the
numbers of which may be reckoned by tens of thousands. They vary
in height from 6 feet to 80 feet, and are generally of a circular
form; being found either separately or in groups. Most frequently
only one skeleton is found in them, either reduced almost to ashes,
or&mdash;which is more rare&mdash;in its ordinary condition, and in a crouching
posture. By the side of the corpse are deposited trinkets, and, in a
few cases, weapons. A practice the very contrary to this now obtains
in America; and from this we may conclude that a profound modification
of their ideas has taken place among the Indians since the pre-historic
epochs.</p>

<p>It is now almost a certain fact that some of the small <i>tumuli</i> are
nothing but the remains of mud-huts, especially as they do not
contain either ashes or bones. Others, on the contrary, and some of
the largest, contain a quantity of bones; the latter must be allied
with the <i>ossuaries</i> or bone-pits, some of which contain the remains
of several thousand individuals.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"> [Pg 339]</a></span></p>
<p>It would be difficult to explain the existence of accumulations of
this kind if we did not know from the accounts of ancient authors
that the Indians were in the habit of assembling every eight or ten
years in some appointed spot to inter all together in one mass the
bones of their dead friends, which had been previously exhumed.
This singular ceremony was called "the feast of the dead."</p>

<p>We shall not say much here as to the <i>sacrificial mounds</i>, because
no very precise agreement has yet been arrived at as to their exact
signification. Their chief characteristics are, that, in the first place,
they are nearly always found within certain sacred enclosures of
which we shall have more to say further on, and also that they cover
a sort of altar placed on the surface of the ground, and made of stone
or baked clay. In the opinion of certain archæologists, this supposed
altar is nothing but the site of a former fire-hearth, and the mound
itself a habitation converted into a tomb after the death of its proprietor.
It will therefore be best to reserve our judgment as to the
existence of the human sacrifices of which these places might have
been the scene, until we obtain some more complete knowledge of the
matter.</p>

<p>The <i>Temple-Mounds</i> are hillocks in the shape of a truncated pyramid,
with paths or steps leading to the summit, and sometimes with
terraces at different heights. They invariably terminate in a platform
of varying extent, but sometimes reaching very considerable dimensions.
That of Cahokia, in Illinois, is about 100 feet in height, and at the
base is 700 feet long and 500 feet wide. There is no doubt that
these mounds were not exclusively used as temples, and, adopting as
our authority several instances taken from Indian history, we may be
permitted to think that on this upper terrace they were in the habit
of building the dwelling of their chief.</p>

<p>The most curious of these earthworks are, beyond question, those
which the American archæologists have designated by the name of
<i>animal-mounds</i>. They consist of gigantic bas-reliefs formed on the
surface of the ground, and representing men, mammals, birds, reptiles,
and even inanimate objects, such as crosses, pipes, &amp;c. They exist in
thousands in Wisconsin, being chiefly found between the Mississippi
and Lake Michigan, and along the war-path of the Indians. Their
height is never very considerable, and it is but seldom that they reach
so much as 6 feet; but their length and breadth is sometimes enormously
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340"> [Pg 340]</a></span>
developed. Many of these figures are copied very exactly
from Nature; but there are, on the other hand, some the meaning of
which it is very difficult to discover, because they have been injured
by the influence of atmospheric action during a long course of ages.</p>

<p>In Dale county there is an interesting group composed of a man with
extended arms, six quadrupeds, a simple <i>tumulus</i>, and seven mounds
without any artistic pretensions. The man measured 125 feet long,
and nearly 140 feet from the end of one arm to the other. The
quadrupeds are from 100 to 120 feet long.</p>

<p>The representation of lizards and tortoises are frequently recognised
in these monstrous figures. A group of mounds, situate near
the village of Pewaukee, included when it was discovered two lizards
and seven tortoises. One of these tortoises measured 470 feet. At
Waukesha there was found a monstrous "turtle" admirably executed,
the tail of which stretched over an extent of 250 feet.</p>

<p>On a high hill near Granville, in the state of Ohio, a representation
is sculptured of the reptile which is now known under the name of
alligator. Its paws are 40 feet long, and its total length exceeds 250
feet. In the same state there exists the figure of a vast serpent, the
most remarkable work of its kind; its head occupies the summit of a
hill, round which the body extends for about 800 feet, forming graceful
coils and undulations; the mouth is opened wide, as if the monster
was swallowing its prey. The prey is represented by an oval-shaped
mass of earth, part of which lies in the creature's jaws. This mass of
earth is about 160 feet long and 80 feet wide, and its height is about
4 feet. In some localities excavations are substituted for these raised
figures; that is to say, that the delineations of the animals are sunk
instead of being in relief-a strange variety in these strange works.</p>

<p>The mind may readily be perplexed when endeavouring to trace
out the origin and purpose of works of this kind. They do not, in a
general way, contain any human remains, and consequently could not
have been intended to be used as sepulchres. Up to the present time,
therefore, the circumstances which have accompanied the construction
of these eminently remarkable pre-historic monuments are veiled in
the darkest mystery.</p>

<p>We now have to speak of those enclosures which are divided by
American archæologists into the classes of <i>defensive</i> and <i>sacred</i>. This
distinction is, however, based on very uncertain data, and it is probable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"> [Pg 341]</a></span>
that a large portion of the so-called <i>sacred</i> enclosures were in the first
place constructed for a simply <i>defensive</i> purpose. They were, in
general, composed of a wall made of stones, and an internal or external
ditch. They often assumed the form of a parallelogram, and
even of a perfect square or circle, from which it has been inferred
that the ancient Indians must have possessed an unit of measurement,
and some means of determining angles. These walls sometimes embraced
a considerable area, and not unfrequently inside the principal
enclosure there were other smaller enclosures, flanked with defensive
mounds performing the service of bastions. In some cases enclosures
of different shapes are grouped side by side, either joined by avenues
or entirely independent of one another.</p>

<p>The most important of these groups is that at Newark, in the
Valley of Scioto; it covers an area of 4 square miles, and is composed
of an octagon, a square, and two large circles. The external wall of
one of these circles is even at the present day 50 feet in width at the
base, and 13 feet high; there are several doorways in it, near which
the height of the wall is increased about 3 feet. Inside there is a
ditch 6 feet in depth, and 13 feet in the vicinity of the doors, its width
being about 40 feet. The whole enclosure is now covered by gigantic
trees, perhaps 500 or 600 years old&mdash;a fact which points to a
considerable antiquity for the date of its construction.</p>

<p>When we reflect on the almost countless multitude, and the magnificent
proportions of the monuments we have just described, we are
compelled to recognise the fact that the American valleys must at
some early date have been much more densely populated than at the
time when Europeans first made their way thither. These peoples
must have formed considerable communities, and have attained to a
somewhat high state of civilisation&mdash;at all events a state very superior
to that which is at present the attribute of the Indian tribes.</p>

<p>Tribes which were compelled to seek in hunting their means of
every-day existence, could never have succeeded in raising constructions
of this kind. They must therefore necessarily have found other
resources in agricultural pursuits.</p>

<p>This inference is moreover confirmed by facts. In several localities
in the United States the ground is covered with small elevations
known under the name of <i>Indian corn-hills</i>; they take their rise from
the fact that the maize, having been planted every year in the same
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"> [Pg 342]</a></span>
spot, has ultimately, after a long course of time, formed rising
grounds. The traces of ancient corn-patches have also been discovered
symmetrically arranged in regular beds and parallel rows.</p>

<p>Can any date be assigned to this period of semi-civilisation which,
instead of improving more and more like civilisation in Europe, became
suddenly eclipsed, owing to causes which are unknown to us? This
question must be answered in the negative, if we are called upon to
fix any settled and definite date. Nevertheless, the conclusion to
which American archæologists have arrived is, that the history of the
New World must be divided into four definite periods.</p>

<p>The first period includes the rise of agriculture and industrial
skill; the second, the construction of mounds and inclosures; the
third, the formation of the "garden beds." In the last period, the
American nation again relapsed into savage life and to the free
occupation of the spots which had been devoted to agriculture.</p>

<p>In his work on 'Pre-historic Times' Sir John Lubbock, who has
furnished us with most of these details, estimates that this course of
events would not necessarily have required a duration of time of more
than 3000 years, although he confesses that this figure might be
much more considerable. But Dr. Douler, another <i>savant</i>, regards
this subject in a very different way. Near New Orleans he discovered
a human skeleton and the remains of a fire, to which,
basing his calculations on more or less admissible <i>data</i>, he attributes
an antiquity of 500 centuries! Young America would thus be very
ancient indeed!</p>

<p>By this instance we may see how much uncertainty surrounds the
history of primitive man in America; and it may be readily understood
why we have thought it necessary to adhere closely to scientific
ideas and to limit ourselves to those facts which are peculiar to
Europe. To apply to the whole world the results which have been
verified in Europe is a much surer course of procedure than describing
local and imperfectly studied phenomena, which, in their interpretation,
lead to differences in the estimate of time, such as that between
3000 and 50,000 years!</p>

<h2><a name="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> bringing our work to a close we may be permitted to retrace
the path we have trod, and to embrace in one rapid glance the
immense space we have traversed.</p>

<p>We have now arrived at a point of time very far removed from that
of the dweller in caves, the man who was contemporary with the
great bear and the mammoth! Scarcely, perhaps, have we preserved
a reminiscence of those mighty quadrupeds whose broad shadows
seem to flit indistinctly across the dim light of the quaternary epoch.
Face to face with these gigantic creatures, which have definitively
disappeared from the surface of our globe, there were, as we have
seen, beings of a human aspect who, dwelling in caves and hollows of
the earth, clothed themselves in the skins of beasts and cleft flakes
of stone in order to form their weapons and implements. We can
hardly have failed to feel a certain interest in and sympathy with
them, when tracing out the dim vestiges of their progress; for, in
spite of their rude appearance, in spite of their coarse customs and
their rough mode of life, they were our brethren, our ancestors, and
the far-distant precursors of modern civilisation.</p>

<p>We have given due commendation to their efforts and to their
progress. After a protracted use of weapons and implements simply
chipped out of the rough flint, we have seen them adopt weapons and
instruments of polished stone, that is, objects which had undergone
that material preparation which is the germ of the industrial skill of
primitive nations.</p>

<p>Aided by these polished-stone instruments, added to those of bone
and reindeer's or stag's horn, they did not fear to enter into a conflict&mdash;which
every day became more and more successful&mdash;with all the
external forces which menaced them. As we have seen, they brought
under the yoke of servitude various kinds of animals; they made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"> [Pg 344]</a></span>
the dog and the horse the companion and the auxiliary of their
labour. The sheep, the ox, and other ruminants were converted into
domesticated cattle, capable of insuring a constant supply of food.</p>

<p>After the lapse of ages metals made their appearance!&mdash;metals, the
most precious acquisition of all, the pledge of the advent of a new
era, replete with power and activity, to primitive man. Instruments
made of stone, bone, reindeer or stag's horn, were replaced by those
composed of metal. In all the communities of man civilisation and
metals seem to be constant companions. Though bronze may have
served for the forging of swords and spears, it also provides the
material for implements of peaceful labour. Owing to the efforts of
continuous toil, owing also to the development of intelligence which
is its natural consequence, the empire of man over the world of nature
is still increasing, and man's moral improvement follows the same law
of progression. But who shall enumerate the ages which have elapsed
whilst these achievements have been realised?</p>

<p>But thy task is not yet terminated! Onward, and still onward,
brave pioneer of progress! The path is a long one and the goal is
not yet attained! Once thou wert contented with bronze, now thou
hast iron&mdash;iron, that terrible power, whose function is to mangle and
to kill&mdash;the cause of so much blood and so many bitter tears; but
also the beneficent metal which fertilises and gives life, affording
nutriment to the body as well as to the mind. The Romans applied
the name of <i>ferrum</i> to the blade of their swords; but in after times
<i>ferrum</i> was also the term for the peaceful ploughshare. The metal
which had brought with it terror, devastation, and death, erelong
introduced among nations peace, wealth and happiness.</p>

<p>And now, O man, thy work is nearly done! The mighty conflicts
against nature are consummated, and thy universal empire is for ever
sure! Animals are subject to thy will and even to thy fancies. At
thy command, the obedient earth opens its bosom and unfolds the
riches it contains. Thou hast turned the course of rivers, cleared the
mountain sides of the forests which covered them, and cultivated the
plains and valleys; by thy culture the earth has become a verdant
and fruitful garden. Thou hast changed the whole aspect of the
globe, and mayst well call thyself the lord of creation!</p>

<p>Doubtless the expanding circle of thy peaceful conquests will not
stop here, and who can tell how far thy sway may extend? Onward
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"> [Pg 345]</a></span>
then! still onward! proud and unfettered in thy vigilant and active
course towards new and unknown destinies!</p>

<p>But look to it, lest thy pride lead thee to forget thy origin.
However great may be thy moral grandeur, and however complete
thy empire over a docile nature, confess and acknowledge every hour
the Almighty Power of the great Creator. Submit thyself before thy
Lord and Master, the God of goodness and of love, the Author of thy
existence, who has reserved for thee still higher destinies in another
life. Learn to show thyself worthy of the supreme blessing&mdash;the happy
immortality which awaits thee in a world above, if thou hast merited
it by a worship conceived in spirit and in truth, and by the fulfilment
of thy duty both towards God and towards thy neighbour!</p>

<h3>Transcriber's Note:</h3>

<ul>

 Obvious punctuation and spelling errors repaired.
 Word combinations that appeared with and without hyphens
 were changed to the predominant hyphenated form.
 Original spelling and its variations were not standardized.
 </li>
 <li class= "bottspace5">
 Corrections in the spelling of names were made when those
 could be verified.  Otherwise the variations were left as they were.
 </li>
 <li class= "bottspace5">
 Footnotes were moved to the ends of the chapters in which
 they belonged and numbered in one continuous sequence.</li>
 <li class= "bottspace5">
 The text for
